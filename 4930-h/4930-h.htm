<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may interest the readers of this
collection of tales, if there should be any such, to know that
the incidents upon which the stories are based are unfortunately
wholly truthful.&nbsp; They have one and all come under the
author&rsquo;s observation during the past ten years, and with
the exception of &ldquo;Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s Jewel,&rdquo;
concerning whom it is expressly stated that she was employed
through lack of other available material, not one of the servants
herein made famous or infamous, as the case may be, was employed
except upon presentation of references written by responsible
persons that could properly have been given only to domestics of
the most sterling character.&nbsp; It is this last fact that
points the moral of the tales here presented, if it does not
adorn them.</p>

<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
EMANCIPATION OF THADDEUS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were very young, and possibly
too amiable.&nbsp; Thaddeus was but twenty-four and Bessie
twenty-two when they twain, made one, walked down the middle
aisle of St. Peter&rsquo;s together.</p>
<p>Everybody remarked how amiable she looked even then; not that
a bride on her way out of church should look unamiable, of
course, but we all know how brides do look, as a rule, on such
occasions&mdash;looks difficult of analysis, but strangely
suggestive of determined timidity, if there can be such a quality
expressed in the human face.&nbsp; It is the natural expression
of one who knows that she has taken the most important step of
her life, and, on turning to face those who have been bidden to
witness the ceremony, observes that the sacredness of the
occasion is somewhat marred by the presence in church of the
unbidden curiosity-seekers, who have come for much the same
reason as that which prompts them to go to the theatre&mdash;to
enjoy the spectacle.&nbsp; But Bessie&rsquo;s face showed nothing
but that intense amiability for which she had all her life long
been noted; and as for Thaddeus, he never ceased to smile from
the moment he turned and faced the congregation until the
carriage door closed upon him and his bride, and then, of course,
he had to, his lips being otherwise engaged.&nbsp; Indeed,
Thaddeus&rsquo;s amiability was his greatest vice.&nbsp; He had
never been known to be ill-natured in his life but once, and that
was during the week that Bessie had kept him in suspense while
she was making up her mind not to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to an
important proposition he had made&mdash;a proposition,
by-the-way, which resulted in this very ceremony, and was largely
responsible for the trials and tribulations which followed.</p>
<p>Thaddeus was rich&mdash;that is, he had an income and a
vocation; a charming little home was awaiting their coming, off
in a convenient suburb; and, best of all, Bessie was an
accomplished house-keeper, having studied under the best
mistresses of that art to be found in the country.&nbsp; And even
if she had not completely mastered the art of keeping house,
Thaddeus was confident that all would go well with them, for
their waitress was a jewel, inherited from Bessie&rsquo;s mother,
and the cook, though somewhat advanced in years, was beyond
cavil, having been known to the family of Thaddeus for a longer
period than Thaddeus himself had been.&nbsp; The only uncertain
quantity in the household was Norah, the up-stairs girl, who was
not only new, but auburn-haired and of Celtic extraction.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances did the young couple start in life,
and many there were who looked upon them with envy.&nbsp; At
first, of course, the household did not run as smoothly as it
might have done&mdash;meals were late, and served with less
ceremony than either liked; but, as Bessie said, as she and
Thaddeus were finishing their breakfast one morning, &ldquo;What
could you expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Thaddeus, with his customary smile, replied
&ldquo;What, indeed!&nbsp; We get along much better than I really
thought we should with old Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Ellen was the cook, and she had been known to Thaddeus as
&ldquo;Old Ellen&rdquo; even before his lips were able to utter
the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen has her ways, and Jane has hers,&rdquo; said
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;After Jane has got accustomed to
Ellen&rsquo;s way of getting breakfast ready, she will know
better how to go about her own work.&nbsp; I think, perhaps,
cook&rsquo;s manner is a little harsh.&nbsp; She made Jane cry
about the omelet this morning; but Jane is teary,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to have Ellen oily and Jane
watery,&rdquo; Thaddeus answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;d mix
worse than ever then.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in pretty good luck as it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too, Teddy,&rdquo; Bessie replied;
&ldquo;but Jane is so foolish.&nbsp; She might have known better
than to send the square platter down to Ellen for an omelet, when
the omelet was five times as long as it was broad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always had square omelets, though, at your
house&mdash;that is, whenever I was there you had,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I suppose Jane&rsquo;s notion is that
as things happened under your mother&rsquo;s r&eacute;gime, so
they ought to happen here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly that was her notion,&rdquo; replied Bessie;
&ldquo;but, then, in your family the omelets were oblong, and
Ellen is too old to depart from her traditions.&nbsp; Old people
get set in their ways, and as long as results are satisfactory,
we ought not to be captious about methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, we shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; smiled Thaddeus;
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want you to give in to Ellen to too
great an extent, my dear.&nbsp; This is your home, and not my
mother&rsquo;s, and your ways must be the ways of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen is all right,&rdquo; returned Bessie, &ldquo;and
I am so delighted to have her, because, you know, Teddy dear, she
knows what you like even better, perhaps, than I
do&mdash;naturally so, having grown up in your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reverse that, my dear.&nbsp; Our family grew up on
Ellen.&nbsp; She set the culinary pace at home.&nbsp; Mother
always let her have her own way, and it may be she is a little
spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Teddy, I wonder that, having had Ellen for
so many years, your mother was willing to give her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can explain that,&rdquo; Thaddeus answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the youngest, you know; the rest of the family
were old enough to be weaned.&nbsp; Besides, father was getting
old, and he had a notion that the comforts of a hotel were
preferable to the discomforts of house-keeping.&nbsp; Father
likes to eat meals at all hours, and the annunciator system of
hotel life, by which you can summon anything in an instant, from
a shower-bath to a feast of terrapin, was rather pleasing to
him.&nbsp; He was always an admirer of the tales of the genii,
and he regards the electric button in a well-appointed hotel as
the nearest approach to the famous Aladdin lamp known to
science.&nbsp; You press the button, and your genii do the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a hotel isn&rsquo;t home,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hotel isn&rsquo;t this home,&rdquo; answered
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love in a cottage for me; but, Bessie,
perhaps you&mdash;perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea for you
to speak to Jane and Ellen this morning about their
differences.&nbsp; I am an hour late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Thaddeus kissed Bessie, and went down to business.</p>
<p>On Thaddeus&rsquo;s departure Bessie&rsquo;s cheerfulness also
deserted her, and for the first time in her life she felt that it
would do her good if she could fly out at
somebody&mdash;somebody, however, who was not endeared to the
heart of Thaddeus, or too intimately related to her own family,
which left no one but Norah upon whom to vent the displeasure
that she felt.&nbsp; Norah was, therefore, sought out, and
requested rather peremptorily to say how long it had been since
she had dusted the parlor; to which Norah was able truthfully to
answer, &ldquo;This mornin&rsquo;, mim.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
Bessie&rsquo;s desire to be disagreeable departed, and saying
that Norah could now clean the second-story front-room windows,
she withdrew to her own snug sewing-room until luncheon should be
served.&nbsp; She was just a trifle put out with Norah for being
so efficient.&nbsp; There is nothing so affronting to a young
house-keeper as the discovery that the inherited family jewels,
upon whom much reliance has been placed, are as paste alongside
of the newly acquired bauble from whom little was expected.&nbsp;
It was almost unkind in Norah, Bessie thought, to be so
impeccably conscientious when Jane and Ellen were developing
eccentricities; but there was the consoling thought that when
they had all been together a month or two longer, their
eccentricities would so shape themselves that they would fit into
one another, and ultimately bind the little domestic structure
more firmly together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if I let them alone,&rdquo; Bessie said to
herself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll forget their differences more
quickly.&nbsp; I guess, on the whole, I will say nothing about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, when Thaddeus came home, the first thing he said
to his wife was: &ldquo;Well, I suppose you were awfully firm
this morning, eh?&nbsp; Went down into the kitchen and roared
like a little tyrant, eh?&nbsp; I really was afraid to read the
paper on the way home.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t know but what I&rsquo;d
read of a &lsquo;Horrid Accident in High Life.&nbsp; Mrs.
Thaddeus Perkins&rsquo;s Endeavor to Maintain Discipline in the
Household Results Fatally.&nbsp; Two Old Family Servants
Instantly Killed, and Three of the Kitchen Table Legs Broken by a
Domestic Explosion!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be serious, Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>And Thaddeus became instantly serious.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t left us, have they?&rdquo;
he whispered, in an awe-struck tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d let them fight it
out between themselves,&rdquo; replied Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see, Thaddeus, servants are queer, and do not like to have their
differences settled by others than themselves.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll
work out all right, if we let them alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but that you are right,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, after a few moments of thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both sensible girls, and capable of fighting
their own battles.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have dinner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
hungry as a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was half-past six o&rsquo;clock, and the usual hour for
dinner.&nbsp; At 8.10 dinner was served.&nbsp; The intervening
time was consumed by Jane and Ellen endeavoring to settle their
differences by the silent, sniffy method&mdash;that is, Jane
would sniff, and Ellen would be silent; and then Ellen would
sniff, and Jane would be silent.&nbsp; As for Thaddeus and
Bessie, they were amused rather than angry to have the dear
little broiled chicken Bessie had provided served on the large
beef-platter; and when the pease came up in a cut-glass
salad-dish, Thaddeus laughed outright, but Bessie&rsquo;s eyes
grew moist.&nbsp; It was too evident that Jane and Ellen were not
on speaking terms, and there was strong need for some one to
break the ice.&nbsp; Fortunately, Bessie&rsquo;s mother called
that evening, and some of her time was spent below-stairs.&nbsp;
What she said there only Ellen and Jane knew, but it had its
effect, and for two or three weeks the jewels worked almost as
satisfactorily as did Norah, the new girl, and quite
harmoniously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessie,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, one night as they ate
their supper, &ldquo;does it occur to you that the roast is a
little overdone to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Teddy, it is very much overdone.&nbsp; I must
speak to Ellen about it.&nbsp; She is a little careless about
some things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve told her several times that you
like your beef rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d tell her again.&nbsp; Constant dropping
of water on its surface will wear away a stone, and I think,
perhaps, the constant dropping of an idea on a cook&rsquo;s head
may wear away some of the thickest parts of that&mdash;at least,
until it is worn thin enough for the idea to get through to where
her brain ought to be.&nbsp; You might say to her, too, that for
several nights past dinner has been cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to her in the morning,&rdquo; was
Bessie&rsquo;s reply; and the dear little woman was true to her
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She explained about the beef and the cold dinner,
Ted,&rdquo; she said, when Thaddeus came home that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfactorily to all hands, I hope?&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, with his usual smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perfectly.&nbsp; In fact, I wonder we hadn&rsquo;t
thought of it ourselves.&nbsp; In the old home, you know, the
dinner-hour was six o&rsquo;clock, while here it is half-past
six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has that got to do with it?&rdquo; asked
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How obtuse of you, Teddy!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, the poor old thing has
been so used to six-o&rsquo;clock dinners that she has everything
ready for us at six?&nbsp; And if we are half an hour late, of
course things get cold; or if they are kept in the oven, as was
the case with the beef last night, they are apt to be
overdone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Wonder I
didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; laughed Thaddeus, though his
mirth did seem a little forced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s going to change, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d try,&rdquo; Bessie replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was really so very nice about it, I hadn&rsquo;t the
heart to scold her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; was all Thaddeus said, and
during the rest of the meal he was silent.&nbsp; Once or twice he
seemed on the verge of saying something, but apparently changed
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you tired to-night, dear?&rdquo; said Bessie, as
the dessert was served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo; said Thaddeus, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&nbsp; I thought you seemed a little
so,&rdquo; Bessie answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t work
too hard down-town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear girl,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I was thinking all through
dinner about those girls down-stairs.&nbsp; Perhaps&mdash;perhaps
I had better talk to them, eh?&nbsp; You are so awfully
kind-hearted, and it does seem to me as though they imposed a
little on you, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; The salad to-night was
atrocious.&nbsp; It should have been kept on the ice, instead of
which it comes to the table looking like a last year&rsquo;s
bouquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie&rsquo;s eyes grew watery.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
it was my fault,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought to have
looked after the salad myself.&nbsp; I always did at home.&nbsp;
I suppose Jane got it out expecting me to prepare it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, never mind,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, desirous of
soothing the troubled soul of his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned it, only Jane does too much
thinking, in a thoughtless way, anyhow.&nbsp; Servants
aren&rsquo;t paid to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie,
her spirits returning, &ldquo;we are just as much to blame as
they are; we&rsquo;ve taken too much for granted, and so have
they.&nbsp; Suppose we spend the evening putting together a set
of rules for the management of the house?&nbsp; It will be lots
of fun, and perhaps it will do the girls good.&nbsp; They ought
to understand that while our parents have had their
ways&mdash;and reasonable ways&mdash;there is no reason why we
should not have our ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;what we
want to draw up is a sort of Declaration of
Independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, exactly,&rdquo; Bessie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get a slate and write them on that,&rdquo;
suggested Thaddeus, with a broad grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we can
rub out whatever Jane and Ellen don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate you when you are sarcastic,&rdquo; said Bessie,
with a pout, and then she ran for her pad and pencil.</p>
<p>The evening was passed as she had suggested, and when they
retired that night the house of Perkins was provided with a
constitution and by-laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall recognize my surroundings
when I get back home to-night,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, when he
waked up in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;What strange
transformation is there to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The discipline will be so strict,&rdquo; answered
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I presume you will put those rules of ours
into operation right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about that,&rdquo; said Bessie,
after a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Thad, there are a great
many things about running a house that neither you nor I are
familiar with yet, and it seems to me that maybe we&rsquo;d
better wait a little while before we impose these rules on the
girls; it would be awkward to have to make changes afterwards,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; said Thaddeus;
&ldquo;but, after all, not so much as you seem to think.&nbsp;
All rules have exceptions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt that the
cook will take exception to most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of, and as
she&rsquo;s so old I kind of feel as if I ought to respect her
feelings a little more than we would Norah&rsquo;s, for
instance.&nbsp; I can just tell you I shall make Norah stand
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good plan if you did,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Norah will die if you
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She works too hard to be a real
servant&mdash;real servants stand around so much, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be flippant, Thaddeus.&nbsp; This is a very
serious matter.&nbsp; Norah is a good girl, as you say.&nbsp; She
works so much and so quickly that she really makes me tired, and
I&rsquo;m constantly oppressed with the thought that she may get
through with whatever she is doing before I can think of
something else to occupy her time.&nbsp; But with her we need
have none of the feeling that we have with Jane and Ellen.&nbsp;
She is young, and susceptible to new impressions.&nbsp; She can
fall in with new rules, while the other two might chafe under
them.&nbsp; Now, I say we wait until we find out if we cannot let
well enough alone, and not raise discord in our home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was an Eden without its serpent,&rdquo;
sighed Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly like the idea
of fitting our rules to their idiosyncrasies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, dear.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
that, either; but neither do we wish to unnecessarily hamper them
in their work by demanding that they shall do it our
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you are the President of the Republic,&rdquo;
said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;You run matters to suit yourself, and
I believe we&rsquo;ll have the most prosperous institution in the
world before we know it.&nbsp; If it were a business matter,
I&rsquo;d have those rules or die; but I suppose you can&rsquo;t
run a house as you would a business concern.&nbsp; I guess you
are right.&nbsp; Keep the rules a week.&nbsp; Why not submit
&rsquo;em to your mother first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
then it occurred to me that as Ellen had served always under your
mother, it would be better if we consulted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be sure to tell you not to have any rules, or,
if she didn&rsquo;t, she would advise you to consult with the
cook in the matter, which would result in Ellen&rsquo;s becoming
President, and you and I taxpayers.&nbsp; She used to run our old
house, and now see the consequences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the consequences?&rdquo; asked Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and father have been driven into a hotel, and
the children have all been married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; laughed Bessie.</p>
<p>And so the rules were filed away for future reference.&nbsp;
That they would have remained on file for an indefinite period if
Thaddeus had not asked a friend to spend a few weeks with him, I
do not doubt.&nbsp; Bessie grew daily more mistrustful of their
value, and Thaddeus himself preferred the comfort of a quiet
though somewhat irregular mode of living to the turmoil likely to
follow the imposition of obnoxious regulations upon the
aristocrats below-stairs.&nbsp; But the coming of
Thaddeus&rsquo;s friend made a difference.</p>
<p>The friend was an elderly man, with a business and a
system.&nbsp; He was a man, for instance, who all his life had
breakfasted at seven, lunched at one, and dined at six-thirty, of
which Thaddeus was aware when he invited him to make his suburban
home his headquarters while his own house was being renovated and
his family abroad.&nbsp; Thaddeus was also aware that the
breakfast and dinner hours under Bessie&rsquo;s r&eacute;gime
were nominally those of his friend, and so he was able to assure
Mr. Liscomb that his coming would in no way disturb the usual
serenity of the domestic pond.&nbsp; The trusting friend
came.&nbsp; Breakfast number one was served fifteen minutes after
the hour, and for the first time in ten years Mr. Liscomb was
late in arriving at his office.&nbsp; He had not quite recovered
from the chagrin consequent upon his tardiness when that evening
he sat down to dinner at Thaddeus&rsquo;s house, served an hour
and ten minutes late, Ellen having been summoned by wire to town
to buy a pair of shoes for one of her sister&rsquo;s children,
the sister herself suffering from poverty and toothache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you were not delayed seriously this morning, Mr.
Liscomb,&rdquo; said Bessie, after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not at all!&rdquo; returned Liscomb, polite
enough to tell an untruth, although its opposite was also a part
of his system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen must be more prompt with breakfast,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seven, sharp, is the hour.&nbsp; Did you
speak to her about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I intend to,&rdquo; answered Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her the first thing after breakfast
to-morrow.&nbsp; I meant to have spoken about it to-day, but when
I got down-stairs she had gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it her day out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but her sister is sick, and she was sent for.&nbsp;
It was all right.&nbsp; She left word where she was going with
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very considerate of her,&rdquo; said Liscomb,
politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ellen&rsquo;s a
splendid woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on in the evening, about half-past nine, when Mr.
Liscomb, wearied with the excitement of the first irregular day
he had known from boyhood, retired, Thaddeus took occasion to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessie, I think you&rsquo;d better tell Ellen about
having breakfast promptly in the morning to-night, before we go
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Bessie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
down now and do it;&rdquo; and down she went.&nbsp; In a moment
she was back.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor thing was so tired,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that she went to bed as soon as dinner was
cooked, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send up word to her by
Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she <i>must</i> be asleep by this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning when Ellen opened
her eyes.&nbsp; Breakfast had been served a half-hour earlier,
Jane and Bessie having cooked some eggs, which Bessie ate alone,
since Thaddeus and Liscomb were compelled to take the
eight-o&rsquo;clock train to town, hungry and forlorn.&nbsp;
Liscomb was very good-natured about it to Thaddeus, but his
book-keeper had a woful tale to tell of his employer&rsquo;s
irritability when he returned home that night.&nbsp; As for
Thaddeus, he spoke his mind very plainly&mdash;to Liscomb.&nbsp;
Bessie never knew what he said, nor did any of the servants; but
he said it to Liscomb, and, as Liscomb remarked later, he seemed
like somebody else altogether while speaking, he was so fierce
and determined about it all.&nbsp; That night a telegram came
from Liscomb, saying that he had been unexpectedly delayed, and
that, as there were several matters requiring his attention at
his own home, he thought he would not be up again until
Sunday.</p>
<p>Bessie was relieved, and Thaddeus was mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> have those rules,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And so they were brought out.&nbsp; Ellen received them with
stolid indifference; Jane with indignation, if the slamming of
doors in various parts of the house that day betokened
anything.&nbsp; Norah accepted them without a murmur.&nbsp; It
made no difference to Norah on what day she swept the parlor, nor
did she seem to care very much because her &ldquo;days at
home&rdquo; were shifted, so that her day out was Friday instead
of Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Ellen said anything about the rules, my
dear?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus, a week or two later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; returned Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she &lsquo;looked&rsquo; anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Volumes,&rdquo; Bessie answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she take exception to any of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
discovered why, too.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus was silent for a minute.&nbsp; Then he said, quite
firmly for him, &ldquo;She must read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Must</i> is a strong word, Teddy,&rdquo; Bessie
replied, &ldquo;particularly since Ellen can&rsquo;t
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to read them to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; Bessie answered,
amiably.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do it very
soon&mdash;day after to-morrow, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has Jane said?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus, biting his
lip.</p>
<p>Bessie colored.&nbsp; Jane had expressed herself with
considerable force, and Bessie had been a little afraid to tell
Thaddeus what she had said and done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&mdash;she said she&rsquo;d never worn caps like a
common servant, and wasn&rsquo;t going to begin now; and then she
didn&rsquo;t like having to clean the silver on Saturday
afternoons, because the silver-powder got into her finger-nails;
and that really is too bad, Teddy, because Saturday night is the
night her friends come to call, and silver-powder is awfully hard
to get out of your nails, you know; and, of course, a girl wants
to appear neat and clean when she has callers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
judge by the appearance of the brass fenders that she
doesn&rsquo;t like to polish them up on Wednesday because it
gives her a backache on Thursday, which is her day
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie&rsquo;s eyes took on their watery aspect again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the fenders look so very badly, Ted?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re atrocious,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, dear; but I did my best.&nbsp; I
polished them myself this afternoon; Jane had to go to a
funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; cried Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
subject&rsquo;s too much for me.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
out&mdash;somewhere, anywhere&mdash;to a concert.&nbsp; Music
hath its charms to soothe a savage breast, and my breast is
simply the very essence of wildness to-night.&nbsp; Put on your
things, Bess, and hurry, or I&rsquo;ll suffocate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie did as she was told, and before ten o&rsquo;clock the
happy pair had forgotten their woes, nor do I think they would
have remembered them again that night had they not found on their
return home that they were locked out.</p>
<p>At this even the too amiable Bessie was angry&mdash;very
angry&mdash;unjustly, as it turned out afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t to blame, after all,&rdquo; she
explained to Thaddeus, when he came home the next night.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I spoke to them about it, and they all thought we&rsquo;d
spend the night with your mother and father at the
Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a thoughtful lot,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>And so time passed.&nbsp; The &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; did as
they pleased; the dubious auburn-haired Norah continued her
aggravating efficiency.&nbsp; Bessie&rsquo;s days were spent in
anticipation of an interview of an unpleasant nature with Jane or
Ellen &ldquo;to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thaddeus&rsquo;s former
smile grew less perpetual&mdash;that is, it was always visible
when Bessie was before him, but when Bessie was elsewhere, so
also was the token of Thaddeus&rsquo;s amiability.&nbsp; He
chafed under the tyranny, but it never occurred to him but once
that it would be well for him to interview Ellen and Jane; and
then, summoning them fiercely, he addressed them mildly, ended
the audience with a smile, and felt himself beneath their sway
more than ever.</p>
<p>Then something happened.&nbsp; A day came and went, and the
morrow thereof found Thaddeus dethroned from even his nominal
position of head of the house.&nbsp; There was a young Thaddeus,
an eight-pound Thaddeus, a round, red-cheeked, bald-headed
Thaddeus that looked more like the Thaddeus of old than Thaddeus
did himself; and then, at a period in which man feels himself the
least among the insignificant, did our hero find happiness
unalloyed once more, for to the pride of being a father was added
the satisfaction of seeing Jane and Ellen acknowledge a
superior.&nbsp; Make no mistake, you who read.&nbsp; It was not
to Thaddeus junior that these gems bowed down.&nbsp; It was to
the good woman who came in to care for the little one and his
mother that they humbled themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Thaddeus to himself, as
he watched Jane bustling about to obey the command of the
temporary mistress of the situation as she had never bustled
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a second Elizabeth,&rdquo; chuckled
Thaddeus, as he listened to an order passed down the dumb-waiter
shaft from the stout empress of the moment to the trembling queen
of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little dictatorial,&rdquo; whispered
Thaddeus to his newspaper, when the monarch of all she surveyed
gave him <i>his</i> orders.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there are times,
even in a Republic like this, when a dictator is an
advantage.&nbsp; I hate to see a woman cry, but the way Jane wept
at the routing Mrs. Brown gave her this morning was a finer sight
than Niagara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, alas! this happy state of affairs could not last
forever.&nbsp; Thaddeus was just beginning to get on easy terms
with Mrs. Brown when she was summoned elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change of heir is necessary for one in her
profession,&rdquo; sighed Thaddeus; and then, when he thought of
resuming the reins himself, he sighed again, and wished that Mrs.
Brown might have remained a fixture in the household
forever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added, more to comfort
himself than because he had any decided convictions to
express&mdash;&ldquo;still, a baby in the house will make a
difference, and Ellen and Jane will behave better now that
Bessie&rsquo;s added responsibilities put them more upon their
honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time Thaddeus&rsquo;s prophecy was correct.&nbsp; Ellen
and Jane did do better for nearly two months, and then&mdash;but
why repeat the old story?&nbsp; Then they lapsed, that is all,
and became more tyrannical than ever.&nbsp; Bessie was so busy
with little Ted that the household affairs outside of the nursery
came under their exclusive control.&nbsp; Thaddeus stood
it&mdash;I was going to say nobly, but I think it were better put
ignobly&mdash;but he had a good excuse for so doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baby is an awful care to its mother,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;a responsibility that takes up her whole time and
attention.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d better complicate
matters by getting into a row with the servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it went.&nbsp; A year and another year passed.&nbsp;
The pretty home was beginning to look old.&nbsp; The bloom of its
youth had most improperly faded&mdash;for surely a home should
never fade&mdash;but there was the boy, a growing delight to his
father, so why complain?&nbsp; Better this easy-going life than
one of domestic contention.</p>
<p>Then on a sudden the boy fell ill.&nbsp; The doctor
came&mdash;shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take him to the sea-shore,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is his only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the sea-shore they went, leaving the house in charge of
the treasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have confidence in you,&rdquo; said Thaddeus to Jane
and Ellen on the morning of the departure, &ldquo;so I have
decided to leave the house open in your care.&nbsp; Mrs. Perkins
wants you to keep it as you would if she were here.&nbsp;
Whatever you need to make yourselves comfortable, you may
get.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a comfort it is,&rdquo; said Bessie, when they had
reached the sea-shore, and were indulging in their first bit of
that woful luxury, homesickness&mdash;&ldquo;what a comfort it is
to feel that the girls are there to look after things!&nbsp; An
empty house is such a temptation to thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they
won&rsquo;t entertain too much, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen and Jane are too old for that sort of
thing,&rdquo; Bessie answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Norah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you.&nbsp; There was nothing
really for Norah to do, so I told her she could go off and stay
with her mother on board-wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Thaddeus, with a pleased smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bad idea to save, particularly when you
are staying at the sea-shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this contented frame of mind they lived for several
weeks.&nbsp; The boy grew stronger every day, and finally
Thaddeus felt that the child was well enough to warrant his
running back home for a night, &ldquo;just to see how things were
going.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the girls were faithful, of course, he
did not doubt; the regularity with which letters addressed to him
at home&mdash;and they were numerous&mdash;reached him convinced
him of that; but the hamper containing the week&rsquo;s wash,
which Ellen and Jane were to send, and which had been expected on
Thursday of the preceding week, had failed for once to arrive;
the boy had worn one dress four days, Thaddeus&rsquo;s collars
were getting low, and altogether he was just a little uneasy
about things.&nbsp; So he availed himself of his opportunity and
went home, taking with him a friend, in consideration of whom he
telegraphed ahead to Ellen to prepare a good breakfast, not
caring for dinner, since he and his companion expected to dine at
the club and go to the theatre before going out to his home.</p>
<p>The result would have been fatal to Bessie&rsquo;s peace of
mind had she heard of it during her absence from home.&nbsp; But
Thaddeus never told her, until it was a matter of ancient
history, that when he arrived at home, a little after midnight,
he found the place deserted, and was compelled to usher his
friend in through the parlor window; that from top to bottom the
mansion gave evidence of not having seen a broom or a dust-brush
since the departure of the family; that Jane had not been seen in
the neighborhood for one full week&mdash;this came from those
living on adjoining property; that Ellen had been absent since
early that morning, and was not expected to return for three
days; and, crowning act of infamy, that he, Thaddeus, and his
friend were compelled to breakfast next morning upon a half of a
custard pie, a bit mouldy, found by the lord of the manor on the
fast-melting remains of a cake of ice in the refrigerator.&nbsp;
Whether it would have happened if Thaddeus had not been
accompanied by a friend, whose laughter incited him to great
deeds, or not I am not prepared to say, but something important
did happen.&nbsp; Thaddeus rose to the occasion, and committed an
act, and committed it thoroughly.&nbsp; The Thaddeus of old, the
meek, long-suffering, too amiable Thaddeus, disappeared.&nbsp;
The famous smile was given no chance to play.&nbsp; His wife was
absent, and the smile was far away with her.&nbsp; Thaddeus, with
one fell blow, burst his fetters and became free.</p>
<p>That afternoon, when he had returned to the seaboard, Bessie
asked him, &ldquo;How was the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, quite truthfully; for
it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Ellen say anything about the hamper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you speak to her about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Teddy!&nbsp; How could you forget it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the lasting honor of Thaddeus be it said that he bore up
under this unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a good breakfast, Ted?&rdquo; Bessie
asked, returning to the subject later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, thinking of the hearty meal
he and his fellow-sufferer had eaten at the club after getting
back to town.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had a tomato omelet, coffee, toast,
rice cakes, tenderloin steak, and grits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; smiled Bessie; she was so glad her
Teddy had been so well treated.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that?&nbsp;
Ellen must have laid herself out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus; &ldquo;I think she
did.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All the following week Thaddeus seemed to have a load on his
mind&mdash;a load which he resolutely refused to share with his
wife&mdash;and on Friday he found it necessary to go up to
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought this was your vacation,&rdquo; remonstrated
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so it is,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got one or two matters to attend
to&mdash;matters of very great importance&mdash;so that I think
I&rsquo;ll have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must, you must,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I think it&rsquo;s horrid of your partner to make you
go back to town this hot weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross with my partner,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus; &ldquo;especially my partner in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you different partners for different
matters?&rdquo; queried Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that, my dear; you&rsquo;ll know all
about it in time, so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Teddy.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t like to have
you running away from me when I&rsquo;m at a hotel.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d rather be home, anyhow.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I go with
you?&nbsp; Little Ted is well enough now to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time; but you can go up next Wednesday if you
wish,&rdquo; returned Thaddeus, with a slight show of
embarrassment.</p>
<p>And so it was settled, and Thaddeus went to town.&nbsp; On
Wednesday they all left the sea-shore to return to
Phillipseburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely it looks!&rdquo; ejaculated Bessie, as
she entered the house, Norah having opened the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;er&mdash;where&rsquo;s Jane, Norah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookin&rsquo; the dinner, mim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jane can&rsquo;t cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, mim, this is a new Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie&rsquo;s parasol fell to the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
wha-a-at?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new Jane.&nbsp; Misther Perkins has dispinsed with
old Jane and Ellen, mim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie rushed up-stairs to her room and cried.&nbsp; The shock
was too sudden.&nbsp; She longed for Thaddeus, who had remained
at the station collecting the bath-tubs and other luxuries of the
baby from the luggage-van, to come.&nbsp; What did it all
mean?&nbsp; Jane and Ellen gone!&nbsp; New girls in their
places!</p>
<p>And then Thaddeus came, and made all plain to the little
woman, and when he was all through she was satisfied.&nbsp; He
had discharged the tyrants, and had supplied their places.&nbsp;
The latter was the important business which had taken him to
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Teddy,&rdquo; Bessie said, with a smile, when she
had heard all, &ldquo;how did poor mild little you ever have the
courage to face those two women and give them their
discharge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teddy blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
answered, meekly; &ldquo;I wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five years have passed since then, and all has gone
well.&nbsp; Thaddeus has remained free, and, as he proudly
observes, domestics now tremble at his approach&mdash;that is,
all except Norah, who remembers him as of old.&nbsp; Ellen and
Jane are living together in affluence, having saved their wages
for nearly the whole of their term of
&ldquo;service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bessie is happy in the possession of
two fine boys, to whom all her attention&mdash;all save a little
reserved for Thaddeus&mdash;is given; and, as for the dubious,
auburn-haired, and distinctly Celtic Norah, Thaddeus is afraid
that she is developing into a &ldquo;treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; Bessie asked him, when he
first expressed that fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she has the symptoms,&rdquo; returned
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has taken three nights off this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>MR.
BRADLEY&rsquo;S JEWEL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thaddeus</span> was tired, and, therefore,
Thaddeus was grumpy.&nbsp; One premise only was necessary for the
conclusion&mdash;in fact, it was the only premise upon which a
conclusion involving Thaddeus&rsquo;s grumpiness could find a
foothold.&nbsp; If Thaddeus felt rested, everything in the world
could go wrong and he would smile as sweetly as ever; but with
the slightest trace of weariness in his system the smile would
fade, wrinkles would gather on his forehead, and grumpiness set
in whether things were right or wrong.&nbsp; On this special
occasion to which I refer, things were just wrong enough to give
him a decent excuse&mdash;outside of his weariness&mdash;for his
irritation.&nbsp; Norah, the housemaid, had officiously
undertaken to cover up the shortcomings of John, who should have
blacked Thaddeus&rsquo;s boots, and who had taken his day off
without preparing the extra pair which the lord of the manor had
expected to wear that evening.&nbsp; It was nice of the
housemaid, of course, to try to black the extra pair to keep John
out of trouble, but she might have been more
discriminating.&nbsp; It was not necessary for her to polish,
until they shone like Claude Lorraine glasses, two right boots,
one of which, paradoxical as it may seem, was consequently the
wrong boot; so that when Thaddeus came to dress for the
evening&rsquo;s diversion there was nowhere to be found in his
shoe-box a bit of leathern gear in which his left foot might
appear in polite society to advantage.&nbsp; Possibly Thaddeus
might have endured the pain of a right boot on a left foot, had
not Norah unfortunately chosen for that member a box-toed boot,
while for the right she had selected one with a very decided
acute angle at its toe-end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like a woman!&rdquo; ejaculated Thaddeus,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Bessie, missing Thaddeus&rsquo;s
point slightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was very thoughtful of Norah to
look after John&rsquo;s work, knowing how important it was to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately Thaddeus was out of breath trying to shine up the
other pointed-toe shoe, so that his only reply to this was a
look, which Bessie, absorbed as she was in putting the studs in
Thaddeus&rsquo;s shirt, did not see.&nbsp; If she had seen it, I
doubt if she would have been so entirely happy as the tender
little song she was humming softly to herself seemed to indicate
that she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people are born lucky!&rdquo; growled Thaddeus, as
he finished rubbing up the left boot, giving it a satin finish
which hardly matched the luminous brilliance of its mate, though
he said it would do.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bradley, now; he
never has any domestic woes of this sort, and he pays just half
what we do for his servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bradley.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like him!&rdquo;
ejaculated Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are always talking about Mr.
Bradley, as if he had an automaton for a servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t say he has an automaton,&rdquo;
returned Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Automatons don&rsquo;t often
work, and Bradley&rsquo;s jewel does.&nbsp; Her name is Mary, but
Bradley always calls her his jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of jewels,&rdquo; said Bessie,
thinking of the two Thaddeus and she had begun their married life
with, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ve always seemed to me to be paste
emeralds&mdash;awfully green, and not worth much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no paste emerald about Bradley&rsquo;s
girl,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, he says that woman
has been in Mrs. Bradley&rsquo;s employ for seven weeks now, and
she hasn&rsquo;t broken a bit of china; never sweeps dust under
the beds or bureaus; keeps the silver polished so that it looks
as if it were solid; gets up at six every morning; cooks well; is
civil, sober, industrious; has no hangers-on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Bradley a realist or a romancer?&rdquo; asked
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask that?&rdquo; replied Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That jewel story sounds like an <i>Arabian Nights</i>
tale,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that
it is more than half true, and that half is
exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> true,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, what is more, the girl helps in the washing, plays
with the children, and on her days out she stays at home and does
sewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She must be a regular
Koh-i-noor,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose Mr. Bradley
pays her a thousand dollars a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t; he pays her twelve,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is just what I said he was,&rdquo; snapped
Bessie&mdash;&ldquo;a mean thing.&nbsp; The idea&mdash;twelve
dollars a month for all that!&nbsp; Why, if she could prove she
was all that you say she is, she could make ten times that amount
by exhibiting herself.&nbsp; She is a curiosity.&nbsp; But if I
were Mrs. Bradley I wouldn&rsquo;t have her in the house.&nbsp;
So many virtues piled one on the other are sure to make an unsafe
structure, and I believe some poor, miserable little vice will
crop out somewhere and upset the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jealous,&rdquo; said Thaddeus; and then he went
out.</p>
<p>The next day, meeting his friend Bradley on the street,
Thaddeus greeted him with a smile, and said, &ldquo;Mrs. Perkins
thinks you ought to take up literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Bradley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks De Foe and Scott and Dumas and Stevenson
would be thrown into the depths of oblivion if you were to write
up that jewel of yours,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
thinks your Mary is one of the finest, most imaginative creations
of modern days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doubts her existence, eh?&rdquo; smiled
Bradley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she thinks she&rsquo;s more likely to be a myth
than a Smith,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me to
ask you if Mary has a twin-sister, and to say that if you hear of
her having any relatives at all&mdash;and no domestic ever lived
who hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;to send her their addresses.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d like to employ a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry Mrs. Perkins is so blinded by
jealousy,&rdquo; said Bradley, with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
regret to say that Mary hasn&rsquo;t a cousin on the whole police
force, or, in fact, any kind of a relative whatsoever, unless she
prevaricates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a
vague hope we could stock up on jewels of her kind.&nbsp; Where
did you get her, anyhow&mdash;Tiffany&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; At an unintelligence office,&rdquo; said
Bradley.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a last resort.&nbsp; We had to have
some one, and she was the only girl there.&nbsp; We took her for
a week on trial without references, and, by Jove! she turned out
a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus grinned, and said: &ldquo;Give her time,
Bradley.&nbsp; By-the-way, at what hours is she on
exhibition?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to-night and test the truth of what I
say,&rdquo; said Bradley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let anybody
know you are coming, and you&rsquo;ll see her just as we see
her.&nbsp; What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temptation was too strong for Thaddeus to resist, and so
it was that Bessie received a telegram that afternoon from her
beloved, stating that he would dine with Bradley, and return home
on a late train.&nbsp; The telegram concluded with the line,
&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m going to appraise the escaped
crown-jewel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie chuckled at this, and stayed up until long after the
arrival of the last train, so interested was she to hear from
Thaddeus all about the Bradley jewel, who, as she said,
&ldquo;seemed too good to be true&rdquo;; but she was finally
forced to retire disappointed and somewhat anxious, for Thaddeus
did not return home that night.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the neighborhood of eight o&rsquo;clock the next
morning Bessie received a second telegram, which read as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do not worry</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am all right</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Will be home about nine</i>, <i>Have breakfast</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder what on earth can have kept him?&rdquo;
Bessie said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something has happened, I am
sure.&nbsp; Perhaps an accident on the elevated, or
maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence, but rushed into the library
and snatched up the morning paper, scanning its every column in
the expectation, if not hope, of finding that some horrible
disaster had occurred, in which her Thaddeus might have been
involved.&nbsp; The paper disclosed nothing of the sort.&nbsp;
Only a few commonplace murders, the usual assortment of
defalcations, baseball prophecies, and political prognostications
could Bessie discover therein.&nbsp; Never, in fact, had the
newspaper seemed so uninteresting&mdash;not even a
bargain-counter announcement was there&mdash;and with an
impatient, petulant stamp of her little foot she threw the
journal from her and returned to the dining-room.&nbsp; It was
then half-past eight, and, hardly able to contain herself with
excitement, Bessie sat down by the window, and almost, if not
quite, counted every swing of the pendulum that pushed the hands
of the clock on to the desired hour.&nbsp; She could not eat, and
not until curiosity was gratified as to what it was that had
detained Thaddeus, and that, more singular still, was bringing
him home instead of sending him to business at nine o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, could she, in fact, do anything?</p>
<p>Finally, the grinding sounds of carriage wheels on the gravel
road without were heard, and in an instant Bessie was at the door
to welcome the prodigal.&nbsp; And what a Thaddeus it was that
came home that morning!&nbsp; His eyes showed conclusively that
he had had no sleep, save the more or less unsatisfactory napping
which suburban residents get on the trains.&nbsp; His beautiful
pearl-gray scarf, that so became him when he left home the
previous morning, was not anywhere in sight.&nbsp; His cheek was
scratched, and every button that his vest had ever known had
taken wings unto itself and flown, Bessie knew not whither.&nbsp;
And yet, tired out as he was, dishevelled as he was, Thaddeus was
not grumpy, but inclined rather to explosive laughter as he
entered the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Thaddeus!&rdquo; cried Bessie, in alarm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What on earth is the matter with you?&nbsp; You look as if
you had been in a riot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty good guess, my dear,&rdquo;
returned Thaddeus, with a laugh, &ldquo;but not quite the right
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, what have you been doing?&nbsp; Where have
you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Bradley&rsquo;s, my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been&mdash;been quarrelling with Mr.
Bradley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Bradley&rsquo;s jewel has proved your
husband&rsquo;s Waterloo, as well as the Sedan of Bradley
himself,&rdquo; returned Thaddeus, throwing his head back and
bursting out into a loud guffaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not good at riddles, Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie,
&ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t laughed much myself since that last
train came in last night and didn&rsquo;t bring you.&nbsp; I
think you might tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear little girl,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, walking
to her side and kissing her, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to keep
you in suspense, and of course I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they ate their breakfast, Thaddeus explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I told Bradley that you were a sceptic on the subject of
his jewel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he offered to prove that
she was eighteen carats fine by taking me home with him, an
unexpected guest, by which act he would test her value to my
satisfaction.&nbsp; Of course, having cast doubts upon her
excellence, I had to accept, and at half-past five he and I
boarded an elevated train for Harlem.&nbsp; At six we stood
before Bradley&rsquo;s front door, and as he had left his keys at
the office, he rang the bell and waited.&nbsp; It was a long
wait, considering the presence of a jewel within doors.&nbsp; It
must have lasted fifteen minutes, and even that would have been
but the beginning, in spite of repeated and continuous pulling of
the bell-handle, had we not determined to enter through the
reception-room window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try the basement door?&rdquo; queried Bessie,
with a smile, for it pleased her to hear that the jewel was not
quite flawless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;We rang four
times at the basement, and I should say seven times at the front
door, and then we took to the window.&nbsp; Bradley&rsquo;s is
one of those narrow English-basement houses with a small yard in
front, so that the reception-room window is easy to reach by
climbing over the vault leading to the basement door, which is
more or less of a cellar entrance.&nbsp; Fortunately the window
was unlocked.&nbsp; I say fortunately, because it enabled us to
get into the house, though if I were sitting on a jury I think I
should base an indictment&mdash;one of criminal
negligence&mdash;of the Jewel on the fact that it was
unlocked.&nbsp; It was just the hour, you know, when policemen
yawn and sneak-thieves prowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How careless!&rdquo; vouchsafed Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this time
it worked for the good of all concerned, although my personal
appearance doesn&rsquo;t give any indication that I gained
anything by it.&nbsp; In fact, it would have been better for me
if the house had been hermetically sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dally so much, Thaddeus,&rdquo; put in
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to hear what
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course Bradley was very much concerned,&rdquo;
continued Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was bad enough not to be able
to attract the maid&rsquo;s attention by ringing, but when he
noticed that the house was as dark as pitch, and that despite the
clanging of the bell, which could be heard all over the
neighborhood, even his wife didn&rsquo;t come to the door, he was
worried; and he was more worried than ever when he got
inside.&nbsp; We lit the gas in the hall, and walked back into
the dining-room, where we also lighted up, and such confusion as
was there you never saw!&nbsp; The table-cloth was in a heap on
the floor; Bradley&rsquo;s candelabra, of which he was always so
proud, were bent and twisted out of shape under the table;
glasses broken beyond redemption were strewn round about; and a
mixture of pepper, salt, and sugar was over
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe there have been thieves here,&rsquo;
said Bradley, his face turning white.&nbsp; And then he went to
the foot of the stairs and called up to his wife, but there no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he started on a dead run up the stair.&nbsp; Above
all was in confusion, as in the dining-room.&nbsp; Vases were
broken, pictures hung awry on the walls; but nowhere was Mrs.
Bradley or one of the Bradley children to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we began a systematic search of the house.&nbsp;
Everywhere everything was upside-down, and finally we came to a
door on the third story back, leading into the children&rsquo;s
play-room, and as we turned the knob and tried to open it we
heard Mrs. Bradley&rsquo;s voice from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; she said, her voice
all of a tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is I!&rsquo; returned Bradley.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Open the door.&nbsp; What is the meaning of all
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you have come!&rsquo;
returned Mrs. Bradley, with a sob, and then we heard sounds as of
the moving of heavy furniture.&nbsp; Mrs. Bradley, for some as
yet unexplained reason, seemed to have barricaded herself in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally the door was opened, and Mrs. Bradley buried
her face on her husband&rsquo;s shoulder and sobbed
hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What on earth is the matter?&rsquo; asked
Bradley, as his children followed their mother&rsquo;s lead,
except that they buried their faces in his coat-tail
pockets.&nbsp; &lsquo;What has happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mary!&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Bradley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jewel?&rdquo; asked Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; returned Thaddeus, with a smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was the jewel, alas! now deprived of her former
glorious setting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Mary?&rsquo; asked
Bradley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been behaving outrageously.&nbsp; I
found her this morning,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bradley,
&lsquo;rummaging through my escritoire, throwing things all over
the floor; and when I remonstrated she said she was looking for a
sheet of paper on which to write a letter.&nbsp; I told her she
should have asked me for it, and she replied impertinently that
she never asked favors of anybody.&nbsp; I told her to leave the
room, and she declined to do it, picking up a sofa-pillow and
throwing it at me.&nbsp; I was so overcome I nearly
fainted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she would have been overcome!&nbsp; Such
impudence!&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
isn&rsquo;t a marker to what followed.&nbsp; Why, according to
Mrs. Bradley&rsquo;s story, that escaped Koh-i-noor called her
all sorts of horrible names, threw an empty ink-pot at a
photograph of Bradley himself, that stood on the mantel, and
then, grabbing up a whisk-broom, literally swept everything else
there was on the mantel off to the floor with it.&nbsp; This
done, she began to overturn chairs with an ardor born of temper,
apparently; and, finally, Mrs. Bradley got so frightened that she
ran from the room, and the jewel started in pursuit.&nbsp;
Straight to the nursery ran the lady of the house&mdash;for there
was where the children were, playing house, no doubt, with little
idea that jewels sometimes deteriorated.&nbsp; Once in the
nursery, Mrs. Bradley slammed the door to, locked it, and then,
still fearful, rolled before it the bureau and the
children&rsquo;s cribs.&nbsp; After that the actions of the jewel
could only be surmised.&nbsp; The door was pounded and the
atmosphere of the hall was rent with violent harangues; then a
hurried step was heard as the jewel presumably sailed
below-stairs; then crashings were heard&mdash;crashings which
might have indicated the smashing of windows, of picture-glass,
of mirrors, chairs, and other household appurtenances, after
which, Mrs. Bradley observed, all became still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy! what a trial!&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was she locked up in the nursery all
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From twelve until we rescued her at a little after
six,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then Bradley and I
started out to find the jewel, if possible, and I regret to say
that it was possible.&nbsp; We found her asleep on the kitchen
table, and Bradley hadn&rsquo;t any more sense than to try and
wake her up.&nbsp; He succeeded too well.&nbsp; For the next ten
minutes she was the most wide-awake woman you ever saw, and she
kept us wide awake too.&nbsp; The minute she opened her eyes and
saw us standing before her, she sprang to her feet and made a
rush at Bradley, for which he was totally unprepared, the
consequence of which was that in an instant he found himself
sitting in a very undignified manner, for the head of the house,
on the kitchen floor, trying to collect his somewhat scattered
faculties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she had persuaded Bradley to take a seat, she
turned to shower her attentions on me.&nbsp; I jumped to one
side, but she managed to grab hold of my vest, and hence its
buttonless condition.&nbsp; By this time Bradley was on his feet
again, and, having had the temerity to face his jewel the second
time, he again came off second best, losing one of the
button-holes of his collar in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.&nbsp; I
rushed in from behind, and flirtatiously, perhaps, tried to grab
hold of her hands, coming off the field minus a necktie, but plus
that picturesque scratch you see on my nose.&nbsp; Stopping a
moment to count up my profit and loss, I let Bradley make the
next assault, which resulted in a drawn battle, Bradley losing
his watch and his temper, the jewel losing her breath and her
balance.&nbsp; So it went on for probably three or four minutes
longer, though we certainly acquired several years of experience
in those short minutes, until finally we managed to conquer
her.&nbsp; This done, we locked her up in a closet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she been at the cooking-sherry?&rdquo; asked
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought so at first, and Bradley sent for a
policeman,&rdquo; said Thaddeus &ldquo;but when he came we found
the poor creature too exhausted to be moved, and in a very short
while Mrs. Bradley decided that it was a case for a doctor and
not for a police-justice.&nbsp; So the doctor was summoned, and
we waited, dinnerless, in the dining-room for his verdict, and
finally it came.&nbsp; <i>Bradley&rsquo;s jewel was
insane</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insane!&rdquo; echoed Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad as a hatter,&rdquo; replied Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; said Bessie,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Thaddeus, do you know I am not
surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Teddy, she was too perfect to be in her right
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Thaddeus, after thinking it all over, was inclined to
believe that Bessie was in the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bess, she was perfect&mdash;perfect in the way she
did her work, perfect in the way she smashed things, and nowhere
did she more successfully show the thoroughness with which she
did everything than when it came to removing the buttons from my
vest.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it too bad that the only perfect servant
that ever lived should turn out to be a hopeless maniac?&nbsp;
But I must hurry off, or I&rsquo;ll miss my train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going down to town to-day?&rdquo; asked
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day, above all other days, am I going down,&rdquo;
returned Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am enough of a barbarian to be
unwilling to lose the chance of seeing Bradley, and asking him
how he and his jewel get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thaddeus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be too mean for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you are right.&nbsp; I guess I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But he has rubbed it into me so much about our
domestics that I hate to lose the chance to hit back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; said Bessie, her face flushing
indignantly, and, it may be added, becomingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
that case, perhaps, you might&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;perhaps you
might telegraph and ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Thaddeus did so.&nbsp; As yet he has received no
reply.</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>UNEXPECTED POMP AT THE PERKINS&rsquo;S</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> dear,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, one night, as he and Mrs. Perkins entered the library
after dinner, &ldquo;that was a very good dinner to-night.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All except the salmon,&rdquo; said Bessie, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salmon?&rdquo; echoed Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Salmon?&nbsp; I did not see any salmon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;that was just the
trouble.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t come up, although it was in the
house before dinner, I&rsquo;m certain.&nbsp; I saw it
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellen couldn&rsquo;t have known you intended it for
dinner,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she knew it was for dinner,&rdquo; returned
Bessie, &ldquo;but she made a mistake as to whose dinner it was
for.&nbsp; She supposed it was bought for the kitchen-table, and
when I went down-stairs to inquire about it a few minutes ago it
was fulfilling its assumed mission nobly.&nbsp; There
wasn&rsquo;t much left but the tail and one fin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Thaddeus, &ldquo;I call that a
pretty cool proceeding.&nbsp; Did you give her a talking
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bessie replied, shortly; &ldquo;I despise a
domestic fuss, so I pretended I&rsquo;d gone down to talk about
breakfast.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have breakfast an hour or two
earlier to-morrow, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; queried Thaddeus, his
eyes open wide with astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not going
shopping, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Teddy, I&rsquo;m not; but when I got down-stairs
and realized that Ellen had made the natural mistake of supposing
the fish was for the down-stairs dinner, this being Friday, I had
to think of something to say, and nothing would come except that
we wanted breakfast at seven instead of at eight.&nbsp; It
doesn&rsquo;t do to have servants suspect you of spying upon
them, nor is it wise ever to appear flustered&mdash;so mamma
says&mdash;in their presence.&nbsp; I avoided both by making
Ellen believe I&rsquo;d come down to order an early
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a great Bessie,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I admire you more than ever, my dear, and to
prove it I&rsquo;d get up to breakfast if you&rsquo;d ordered it
at 1 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be more likely to stay up to it,&rdquo;
said Bessie, &ldquo;and then go to bed after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your Napoleonic mind again,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never have thought of that way
out of it.&nbsp; But, Bess,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when I
was praising to-night&rsquo;s dinner I had a special object in
view.&nbsp; I think Ellen cooks well enough now to warrant us in
giving a dinner, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all depends on what we have for dinner,&rdquo;
said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ellen&rsquo;s biscuits are atrocious, I
think, and you know how lumpy the oatmeal always is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we try giving a dinner with the oatmeal and
biscuit courses left out?&rdquo; suggested Thaddeus, with a
grin.</p>
<p>Bessie&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You make very
bright after-dinner speeches, Teddy,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t have a dinner with
nothing but pretty china, your sparkling conversation, and a few
flowers strewn about.&nbsp; It would be particularly satisfactory
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all angels like you, my dear,&rdquo;
Thaddeus returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bradley, for
instance.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d die of starvation before we got to the
second course in a dinner of that kind, and if there is any one
thing that can cast a gloom over a dinner, it is to have one of
the guests die of starvation right in the middle of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradley would never do so ungentlemanly a
thing,&rdquo; said Bessie, laughing heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
too considerate a man for that; he&rsquo;d starve in silence and
without ostentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this sudden access of confidence in Bradley?&rdquo;
queried Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t like
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither I did, until that Sunday he spent with
us,&rdquo; Bessie answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve admired him
intensely ever since.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember, we had
lemon pie for dinner&mdash;one I made myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; said Thaddeus; &ldquo;but I
fail to see the connection between lemon pie and Bradley.&nbsp;
Bradley is not sour or crusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have failed to see if you&rsquo;d
watched Mr. Bradley at dinner,&rdquo; retorted Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He ate two pieces of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just because a man eats two pieces of lemon pie
prepared by your own fair hands you whirl about, and, from
utterly disliking him, call him, upon the whole, one of the most
admirable products of the human race?&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Bessie replied, with a broad smile;
&ldquo;but I did admire the spirit and politeness of the
man.&nbsp; On our way home from church in the morning we were
talking about the good times children have on their little
picnics, and Mr. Bradley said he never enjoyed a picnic in his
life, because every one he had ever gone to was ruined by the
baleful influence of lemon pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t like lemon
pie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hated it,&rdquo; said Bessie, joining in the
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;He added that the original receipt for it
came out of Pandora&rsquo;s box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Bradley!&rdquo; cried Thaddeus, throwing his head
back in a paroxysm of mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hated
pie&mdash;declared his feelings&mdash;and then to be confronted
by it at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He behaved nobly,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ate
his first piece like a man, and then called for a second, like a
hero, when you remarked that it was of my make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have told him it wasn&rsquo;t necessary,
Bess,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt that way myself at first,&rdquo; Bessie
explained; &ldquo;but then I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t let him
know I remembered what he had said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that was better,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But about that dinner.&nbsp; What do you say to our
inviting the Bradleys, Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, the Robinsons, and
the Twinings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many does that make?&nbsp; Eight besides
ourselves?&rdquo; asked Bessie, counting upon her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;ten altogether,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done, dear,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have only eight fruit plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you and I go without fruit?&rdquo; Thaddeus
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; laughed Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would never do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might think the fruit was poisoned if we did,
eh?&rdquo; suggested Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, Mary never could serve dinner for ten; eight
is her number.&nbsp; Last time we had ten people, don&rsquo;t you
remember, she dropped a tray full of dishes, and poured the
claret into the champagne glasses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, so she did,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we came to have only eight fruit
plates.&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it was the
number of people at the table, though.&nbsp; It was Twining
caused the trouble, he had just made the pleasant remark that he
wouldn&rsquo;t have an Irish servant in his house, when Mary
fired the salute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that settles it,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut the Twinings out, and ask the
others.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care much for Mrs. Twining, anyhow;
she&rsquo;s nothing but clothes and fidgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Twining doesn&rsquo;t do much but ask you what you
think of certain things, and then tell you you are all wrong when
he finds out,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
just as well to cut them off this time.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make it
for eight, and have it a week from Thursday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mary&rsquo;s night off,&rdquo; said
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how about having it Friday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Maggie&rsquo;s night off, and there
won&rsquo;t be anybody to mind the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish there
were a baby safe-deposit company somewhere.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
your mother come over and look after him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
The child always develops something every time mother
comes.&nbsp; Not, of course, that I believe she gives it to him,
but she looks for things, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;I know.&nbsp; Then
make it Wednesday.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my busy day down-town, and
I shan&rsquo;t be able to get home much before half-past six, but
if dinner is at seven, there will be time enough for me to
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
write the invitations to-morrow, and, meanwhile, you and I can
get up the menu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oysters to begin with, of course,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;though, you
remember, the last time we had oysters you had to open them,
because the man from the market didn&rsquo;t get here until
half-past seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ellen had never opened any except with a
tack-hammer,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I
remember.&nbsp; But lightning never strikes twice in the same
place.&nbsp; Put down the oysters.&nbsp; Then we&rsquo;ll have
some kind of a pur&eacute;e&mdash;celery pur&eacute;e,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be very good if Ellen can be induced to keep
it thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better tell her we want a celery
consomm&eacute;,&rdquo; suggested Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it
will be sure to be as thick as a dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it will be all right,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What kind of fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bradley likes salmon; Robinson likes sole; Phillips
likes whitebait, and so do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have whitebait,&rdquo; said Bessie,
simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then a saddle of mutton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and an entr&eacute;e of some kind, and next
individual ruddy ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Roman punch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get along without that, I think,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;We want to keep this dinner down to
Mary&rsquo;s comprehension, and I&rsquo;m afraid she
wouldn&rsquo;t know what to make of an ice in the middle of the
dinner.&nbsp; The chances are she&rsquo;d want to serve it
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Teddy.&nbsp; What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest a lemon pie for Bradley,&rdquo; smiled
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to Ellen&rsquo;s making one of her
tipsy-cakes?&rdquo; suggested Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, smacking his lips
with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could eat a million of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Then we can finish up with coffee and
fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was settled.&nbsp; The invitations were sent out, and
Bessie devoted her energies for the next ten days to making
ready.</p>
<p>Ellen&rsquo;s culinary powers were tested at every meal.&nbsp;
For dinner one night she was requested to prepare the
pur&eacute;e, which turned out to be eminently
satisfactory.&nbsp; Thaddeus gave her a few practical lessons in
the art of opening oysters, an art of which he had become a
master in his college days&mdash;in fact, if his own words were
to be believed, it was the sole accomplishment he had there
acquired which gave any significance whatever to his degree of B.
A.&mdash;so that in case the &ldquo;fish gentleman&rdquo; failed
to appear in time nothing disastrous might result.&nbsp; Other
things on the menu were also ordered at various times, and all
went so well that when Thaddeus left home on the chosen Wednesday
morning, it was with a serene sense of good times ahead.&nbsp;
The invited guests had accepted, and everything was
promising.</p>
<p>As Thaddeus had said, Wednesday was his busy day, and never
had it been busier than upon this occasion.&nbsp; Everything
moved smoothly, but there was a great deal to move, and finally,
when all was done, and Thaddeus rose to leave his desk, it was
nearly six o&rsquo;clock, and quite impossible for him to reach
home before seven.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be late,&rdquo; he said,
as he hurried off; and he was right.&nbsp; He arrived at home
coincidently with his guests, rushed to his room, and
dressed.&nbsp; But one glimpse had he of Bessie, and that was as
they passed on the stairs, she hurrying down to receive her
guests, he hurrying up to change his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Thad!&rdquo; was all she said, but to Thaddeus it
was disconcerting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, dear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&nbsp; Hurry,&rdquo;
she gasped, &ldquo;or the dinner will be spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus hurried as he never hurried before, and in fifteen
minutes walked, immaculate as to attire, into the drawing-room,
where Bessie, her color heightened to an unusual degree, and her
usually bright eyes fairly flaming with an unwonted brilliance,
was entertaining the Bradleys, the Phillipses, and the
Robinsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect me, did you?&rdquo; said Thaddeus,
as he entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bradley, dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is an
unexpected pleasure.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even know you were a
friend of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of
the oldest friends I&rsquo;ve got, in fact, which is my sole
excuse for keeping you waiting.&nbsp; Old friends are
privileged&mdash;eh, Mrs. Robinson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner is served,&rdquo; came a deep bass voice from
the middle of the doorway.</p>
<p>Thaddeus jumped as if he had seen a ghost, and, turning to see
what could have caused the strange metamorphosis in the soprano
tremolo of Mary&rsquo;s voice, was astonished to observe in the
parting of the porti&egrave;res not the more or less portly Mary,
but a huge, burly, English-looking man, bowing in a most
effective and graceful fashion to Mrs. Bradley, and then
straightening himself up into a pose as rigid and uncompromising
as that of a marble statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth&mdash;&rdquo; began Thaddeus, with a
startled look of inquiry at Bessie.&nbsp; But she only shook her
head, and put her finger to her lips, enjoining silence, which
Thaddeus, fortunately, had the good sense to understand, even if
his mind was not equal to the fathoming of that other mystery,
the pompous and totally unexpected butler.</p>
<p>But if Thaddeus was surprised to see the butler, he was amazed
at the dinner which the butler served.&nbsp; Surely, he thought,
if Ellen can prepare a dinner like this, she ought to be above
taking sixteen dollars and a home a month.&nbsp; It was simply a
regal repast.&nbsp; The oysters were delicious, and the
pur&eacute;e was superior to anything Thaddeus had ever eaten in
the line of soups in his life&mdash;only it was lobster
pur&eacute;e, and ten times better than Ellen&rsquo;s general run
of celery pur&eacute;e.&nbsp; He winked his eye to denote his
extreme satisfaction to Bessie when he thought no one was
looking, but was overwhelmed with mortification when he observed
that the wink had been seen by the overpowering butler, who
looked sternly at him, as much as to say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow wery
wulgar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must congratulate your cook upon her lobster
pur&eacute;e, Mrs. Perkins,&rdquo; said Mr. Phillips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you ought
to taste her celery pur&eacute;e.&nbsp; She is undoubtedly great
on pur&eacute;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie coughed slightly and shook her head at Thaddeus, and
Thaddeus thought he detected the germ of a smile upon the cold
face of the butler.&nbsp; He was not sure about it, but it
curdled his blood just a little, because that ghost of a smile
seemed to have just a tinge of a sneer in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the same cook you had last time, is
it?&rdquo; asked Bradley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Same one,
though it was my wife who made that lem&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thaddeus,&rdquo; interrupted Bessie, &ldquo;Mrs.
Robinson tells me that she and Mr. Robinson are going down to New
York to the theatre on Friday night.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t we all
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in on any little diversion of that sort.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s
this?&mdash;er&mdash;why, yes, of course.&nbsp; Phillips,
you&rsquo;ll go; and you, too, eh, Bradley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus was evidently much upset again; for, instead of the
whitebait he and Bessie had decided upon for their fish course,
the butler had entered, bearing in a toplofty fashion a huge
silver platter, upon which lay a superb salmon, beautifully
cooked and garnished.&nbsp; This he was now holding before
Thaddeus, and stood awaiting his nod of approval before serving
it.&nbsp; Inasmuch as Thaddeus not only expected whitebait, but
had also never before seen the silver platter, it is hardly
surprising that he should sit staring at the fish in a puzzled
sort of way.&nbsp; He recovered shortly, however, gave the nod
the butler was waiting for, and the dinner proceeded.&nbsp; And
what a dinner it was!&nbsp; Each new course in turn amazed
Thaddeus far more than the course that had preceded it; and now,
when the butler, whom Thaddeus had got more or less used to, came
in bearing a bottle of wine, followed by another stolid,
well-dressed person, who might have been his twin-brother and who
was in reality no more than assistant to the other, Thaddeus
began to fear that the wine he had partaken of had brought about
that duplication of sight which is said to be one of the symptoms
of over-indulgence.&nbsp; Either that or he was dreaming, he
thought; and the alternative was not a pleasant one, for Thaddeus
did not over-indulge, and as a person of intellect he did not
deem it the proper thing to dream at the dinner-table, since the
first requisite of dreaming is falling asleep.&nbsp; This
Thaddeus never did in polite society.</p>
<p>To say that he could scarcely contain himself for curiosity to
know what had occurred to bring about this singular condition of
affairs is to put it with a mildness which justice to Thaddeus
compels me to term criminal.&nbsp; Yet, to his credit be it said,
that through the whole of the repast, which lasted for two hours,
he kept silent, and but for a slight nervousness of manner no one
would have suspected that he was not as he had always been.&nbsp;
Indeed, to none of the party, not even excepting his wife, did
Thaddeus appear to be anything but what he should be.&nbsp; But
when, finally, the ladies had withdrawn and the men remained over
the coffee and cigars, he was compelled to undergo a still
severer test upon his loyalty to Bessie, whose signal to him to
accept all and say nothing he was so nobly obeying.</p>
<p>Bradley began it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d
changed from women to men servants, Perkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; said Thaddeus &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather good change, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; said Phillips.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
fellow served the dinner like a prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s any more than a duke,
though,&rdquo; said Bradley.&nbsp; &ldquo;His manner was quite
ducal&mdash;in fact, too ducal, if Perkins will let me
criticise.&nbsp; He made me feel like a poor, miserable,
red-blooded son of the people.&nbsp; I wanted an olive, and, by
Jove, I didn&rsquo;t dare ask for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; said Robinson, with
a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget that you live in a country where
red blood is as good as blue.&nbsp; Where did you get him,
Thaddeus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus looked like a rat in a corner with a row of cats to
the fore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;we got him from&mdash;dear
me!&nbsp; I never can remember.&nbsp; Mrs. Perkins can tell you,
though,&rdquo; he stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She looks after the
menagerie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; asked Phillips.</p>
<p>Thaddeus&rsquo;s mind was a blank.&nbsp; He could not for the
life of him think what name a butler would be likely to have, but
in a moment he summoned up nerve enough to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grimmins,&rdquo; he said, desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a Dickens&rsquo; character,&rdquo; said
Robinson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he cost you very much,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;not so very much,&rdquo; said Thaddeus,
whose case was now so desperate that he resolved to put a stop to
it all.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his method of doing so was not by
telling the truth, but by a flight of fancy in which he felt he
owed it to Bessie to indulge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t cost much,&rdquo; he
repeated, boldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fact is, he is a man we&rsquo;ve
known for a great many years.&nbsp; He&mdash;er&mdash;he used to
be butler in my grandfather&rsquo;s house in Philadelphia,
and&mdash;er&mdash;and I was there a great deal of the time as a
boy, and Grimmins and I were great friends.&nbsp; When my
grandfather died Grimmins disappeared, and until last month I
never heard a word of him, and then he wrote to me stating that
he was out of work and poor as a fifty-cent
table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te dinner, and would like employment at
nominal wages if he could get a home with it.&nbsp; We were just
getting rid of our waitress, and so I offered Grimmins thirty a
month, board, lodging, and clothes.&nbsp; He came on; I gave him
one of my old dress-suits, set him to work, and there you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said a minute ago Mrs. Perkins got
him?&rdquo; said Bradley, who is one of those disagreeable men
with a memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were talking about the cook,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you talking about
the cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but we ought to have been,&rdquo; said Phillips,
with enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the queen of
cooks.&nbsp; What do you pay her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, glad to get back on the
solid ground of truth once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Phillips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sixteen, and
can cook like that?&nbsp; Take me down and introduce me, will
you, Perkins?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to offer her seventeen to come
and cook for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s join the ladies,&rdquo; said Thaddeus,
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use of our wasting our
sweetness upon each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the head of the house had expected to be relieved from his
unfortunate embarrassments by joining the ladies, he was doomed
to bitter disappointment, for the conversation abandoned at the
table was resumed in the drawing-room.&nbsp; The dinner had been
too much of a success to be forgotten readily.</p>
<p>Thaddeus&rsquo;s troubles were set going again when he
overheard Phillips saying to Bessie, &ldquo;Thaddeus has been
telling us the remarkable story of Grimmins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor were his woes lightened any when he caught Bessie&rsquo;s
reply: &ldquo;Indeed?&nbsp; What story is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the story of the butler&mdash;Grimmins, you
know.&nbsp; How you came to get him, and all that,&rdquo; said
Phillips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, you are to be
congratulated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to know you feel that way,&rdquo; said
Bessie, simply, with a glance at Thaddeus which was full of
wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a treasure,&rdquo; said Bradley; &ldquo;but your
cook is a whole chestful of treasures.&nbsp; And how fortunate
you and Thaddeus are!&nbsp; The idea of there being anywhere in
the world a person of such ability in her vocation, and so poor a
notion of her worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus breathed again, now that the cook was under
discussion.&nbsp; He knew all about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the cook,&rdquo; returned Bradley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mean she did well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Bessie would have answered, or what Thaddeus would have
done next if the conversation had been continued, can be a matter
of unprofitable speculation only, for at this point a wail from
above-stairs showed that Master Perkins had awakened, and the
ladies, considerate of Bessie&rsquo;s maternal feelings, promptly
rose to take their leave, and in ten minutes she and Thaddeus
were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the story of Grimmins,
Thaddeus?&rdquo; she asked, as the door closed upon the departing
guests.</p>
<p>Thaddeus threw himself wearily down upon the sofa and
explained.&nbsp; He told her all he had said about the butler and
the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story of Grimmins,&rdquo; he said,
when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, dear me!&rdquo; cried Bessie, &ldquo;you
told the men that, and I&mdash;I, Thaddeus, told the women the
truth.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s awful.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll never hear the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that they know the truth, Bess,&rdquo;
Thaddeus said, &ldquo;suppose you let me into the secret.&nbsp;
What on earth is the meaning of all this&mdash;two butlers,
silver platters, dinner fit for the gods, and all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all because of the tipsy-cake,&rdquo; said
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus, sitting up and gazing
at his wife as if he questioned her sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tipsy-cake,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
gave Ellen the bottle of brandy you gave me for the tipsy-cake,
and&mdash;and she drank half of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other half?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary drank that.&nbsp; They got word this morning that
their brother was very ill, and it upset them so I don&rsquo;t
believe they knew what they were doing; but at one o&rsquo;clock,
when I went down to lunch, there was no lunch ready, and when I
descended into the kitchen to find out why, I found that the fire
had gone out, and both girls were&mdash;both girls were asleep on
the cellar floor.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re there yet&mdash;locked in;
and all through dinner I was afraid they might come to,
and&mdash;make a rumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dinner?&rdquo; said Thaddeus, a light breaking
through into his troubled mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telegraphed to New York to Partinelli at once,
telling him to serve a dinner for eight here to-night, supplying
service, cook, dinner, and everything, and at four o&rsquo;clock
these men arrived and took possession.&nbsp; It was the only
thing I could do, Thad, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, Bess,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was great; but&mdash;by Jove, I wish I&rsquo;d known,
because&mdash;Did you really tell the ladies the truth about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were
so full of praises for everything that I didn&rsquo;t think it
was fair for me to take all the credit of it, so I told them the
whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was right, too,&rdquo; said Thaddeus; &ldquo;but
those fellows will never let me hear the end of that infernal
Grimmins story.&nbsp; I almost wish we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish what, Teddy dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish we had not attempted the tipsy-cake, and
had stuck to my original suggestion,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Bessie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have lemon pie for dessert, for Bradley&rsquo;s
sake,&rdquo; answered Thaddeus, as he locked the front door and
turned off the gas.</p>
<h2><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>AN
OBJECT-LESSON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early in the autumn.&nbsp;
Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, with their two hopefuls, had returned from
a month of rest at the mountains, and the question of school for
Thaddeus junior came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is nearly six years old,&rdquo; said Bessie,
&ldquo;and I think he is quite intelligent enough to go to
school, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want my honest opinion,&rdquo; Thaddeus
answered, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s intelligent enough to go
without school for another year at least.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
want a hot-house boy, and I have always been opposed to forcing
these little minds that we are called upon by circumstances to
direct.&nbsp; It seems to me that the thing for us to do is to
hold them back, if anything.&nbsp; If Teddy goes to school now,
he&rsquo;ll be ready for college when he is twelve.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be graduated at sixteen, and at twenty he&rsquo;ll be
practising law.&nbsp; At twenty-five he&rsquo;ll be leader of the
bar; and then&mdash;what will there be left for him to achieve at
fifty?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have great hopes for
Teddy, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have,&rdquo; Thaddeus replied; &ldquo;and
why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t he combine all my good
qualities plus yours?&nbsp; How can he be anything else than
great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there&rsquo;s a touch of vanity in
you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins, with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
remark certainly indicates it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s not vanity in me,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s confidence in you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve assured me so often of my perfection that I am
beginning to believe in it; and as for your perfection,
I&rsquo;ve always believed in it.&nbsp; Hence, when I see Teddy
combining your perfect qualities with my own, I regard him as a
supernaturally promising person&mdash;that is, I do until he
begins to show the influence of contact with the hired man, and
uses language which he never got from you or from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granting that he is great at twenty-five,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Perkins, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection, &ldquo;is
that such a horrible thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for the parents of the successful youth,
but for the successful youth himself it&rsquo;s something
awful,&rdquo; returned Thaddeus, with a convincing shake of the
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;If no one ever lived beyond the age of
thirty-five it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, but think of living to
be even so young as sixty, with a big reputation to sustain
through more than half of that period!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
want to have to sustain a big name for twenty-five years.&nbsp;
Success entails conspicuousness, and conspicuousness makes error
almost a crime.&nbsp; Put your mind on it for a moment.&nbsp;
Think of Teddy here.&nbsp; How nervous it would make him in
everything he undertook to feel that the eyes of the world were
upon him.&nbsp; And take into consideration that other
peculiarity of human nature which leads us all, you and me as
well as every one else, to believe that the man who does not
progress is going backward, that there is no such thing as
standing still; then think of a man illustrious enough for
seventy at twenty-five&mdash;at the limit of success, with all
those years before him, and no progress possible!&nbsp; No, my
dear.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of school for Teddy
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t want to force him,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Perkins, &ldquo;but it sometimes seems to me that he needs
lessons in discipline.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be following around
after him all the time, and it seems to me some days that I do
nothing but find fault with him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want him to
think I&rsquo;m a stern mother; and when he tells me, as he did
yesterday, that he wishes I&rsquo;d take a vacation for a month,
I can&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you that?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus, with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d kept him in a chair for an hour because he would
tease Tommy, and when finally I let him go I told him that he was
wearing me out with his naughtiness.&nbsp; About an hour later he
came back and said, &lsquo;You have an awful hard time
bringin&rsquo; me up, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said yes,
and added that he might spare me the necessity of scolding him so
often, to which he replied that he&rsquo;d try, but thought it
would be better if I&rsquo;d take a vacation for a month.&nbsp;
He hadn&rsquo;t much hope for his own improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus shook internally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s perfectly wild, too, at times,&rdquo; Mrs.
Perkins continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wants to do such fearful
things.&nbsp; I caught him sliding down the banisters yesterday
head-foremost, and you know how he was at the Mountain House all
summer long.&nbsp; Perfectly irrepressible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was speaking of it to the doctor up there, and asked him
what he thought I&rsquo;d better do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stated his firm belief that there was nothing you or
I could do to get him down to a basis, but thought Hagenbeck
might accomplish something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt he thought that,&rdquo; cried Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No doubt everybody thought that, but it wasn&rsquo;t
entirely Teddy&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; If there is anything in the
world that is well calculated to demoralize an active-minded,
able-bodied child, it is hotel life.&nbsp; Teddy was egged on to
all sorts of indiscretions by everybody in the hotel, from the
bell-boys up.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;d stand on his head on the
cashier&rsquo;s desk, the cashier would laugh first, and then, to
get rid of him, would suggest that he go into the dining-room and
play with the headwaiter; and when he upset the contents of his
bait-box in Mrs. Harkaway&rsquo;s lap, she interfered when I
scolded him, and said she liked it.&nbsp; What can you do when
people talk that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him to upset his bait-box in her lap again,&rdquo;
said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think if he had been encouraged to
do that as a regular thing, every morning for a week, she&rsquo;d
have changed her tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all goes to prove one thing,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Perkins, &ldquo;and that is, Teddy needs more care than we can
give him personally.&nbsp; We are too lenient.&nbsp; Whenever you
start in to punish him it ends up with a game; when I do it, and
he says something funny, as he always does, I have to
laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the ounce-of-prevention idea?&rdquo;
suggested Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve let him go without a
nurse for a year now&mdash;why can&rsquo;t we employ a maid to
look after him&mdash;not to boss him, but to keep an eye on
him&mdash;to advise him, and, in case he declines to accept the
advice, to communicate with us at once?&nbsp; All he needs is
directed occupation.&nbsp; As he is at present, he directs his
own occupation, with the result that the things he does are of an
impossible sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means another servant for me to manage,&rdquo;
sighed Mrs. Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; but a servant is easier to manage than
Teddy.&nbsp; You can discharge a servant if she becomes
impossible.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got Teddy for keeps,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;so be it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are right, I guess, about school.&nbsp;
He ought not to be forced, and I&rsquo;d be worried about him all
the time he was away, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided that Teddy should have a nurse, and for a
day or two the subject was dropped.&nbsp; Later on Mrs. Perkins
reopened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking all day about Teddy&rsquo;s
nurse, Thaddeus,&rdquo; she said, one evening after dinner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think it would be nice if we got him a French
nurse.&nbsp; Then he could learn French without any
forcing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good scheme,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
approve of that.&nbsp; We might learn a little French from her
ourselves, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; said Bessie and
that point was decided.&nbsp; The new nurse was to be French, and
the happy parents drew beatific visions of the ease with which
they should some day cope with Parisian hotel-keepers and others
in that longed-for period when they should find themselves able,
financially, to visit the French capital.</p>
<p>But&mdash;</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; Those buts that come into our lives!&nbsp;
Conjunctions they are called!&nbsp; Are they not rather
terminals?&nbsp; Are they not the forerunners of chaos in the
best-laid plans of mankind?&nbsp; If for every &ldquo;but&rdquo;
that destroys our plan of action there were ready always some
better-succeeding plan, then might their conjunctive force seem
more potent; as life goes, however, unhappily, they are not
always so provided, and the English &ldquo;but&rdquo; takes on
its Gallic significance, which leads the Frenchman to define it
as meaning &ldquo;the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an object-lesson in store for the Perkinses.</p>
<p>On the Sunday following the discussion with which this story
opens, the Perkinses, always hospitable, though distinctly
unsociable so far as the returning of visits went, received a
visit from their friends the Bradleys.&nbsp; Ordinarily a visit
from one&rsquo;s town friends is no very great undertaking for a
suburban host or hostess, but when the town friends have children
from whom they are inseparable, and those children have nurses
who, whithersoever the children go, go there also, such a visit
takes on proportions the stupendousness of which I, being myself
a suburban entertainer, would prefer not to discuss, fearing lest
some of my friends with families, recalling these words, might
consider my remarks of a personal nature.&nbsp; Let me be content
with saying, therefore, that when the Bradleys, Mr. and Mrs.,
plus Master and Miss, plus Harriet, the English nurse, came to
visit the Perkins homestead that Sunday, it was a momentous
occasion for the host and hostess, and, furthermore, like many
another momentous occasion, was far-reaching in its results.</p>
<p>In short, it provided the Perkins family with that
object-lesson to which I have already alluded.</p>
<p>The Bradleys arrived on Sunday night, and as they came late
little Harry Bradley and the still smaller Jennie Bradley were
tired, and hence not at all responsive to the welcomes of the
Perkinses, large or small.&nbsp; They were excessively
reticent.&nbsp; When Mrs. Perkins, kneeling before Master Harry,
asked him the wholly unnecessary question, &ldquo;Why, is this
Harry?&rdquo; he refused wholly to reply; nor could the
diminutive Jennie be induced to say anything but
&ldquo;Yumps&rdquo; in response to a similar question put to her,
&ldquo;Yumps&rdquo; being, it is to be presumed, a juvenilism for
&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence it was that the
object-lesson did not begin to develop until breakfast on Sunday
morning.&nbsp; The first step in the lesson was taken at that
important meal, when Master Harry observed, in stentorian yet
sweetly soprano tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi wants a glarse o&rsquo; milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which his nurse, standing behind his chair to relieve the
Perkinses&rsquo; maid of the necessity of looking after the
Bradley hopefuls, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ush, &rsquo;Arry, &rsquo;ush!&nbsp; Wite till
yer arsked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bradley nodded approval to Harriet, and observed quietly
to Mrs. Perkins that Harriet was such a treasure; she kept the
children so well in subjection.</p>
<p>The incident passed without making any impression upon the
minds of any but Thaddeus junior, who, taking his cue from Harry,
vociferously asserted that he, too, wished a glass of milk, and
in such terms as made the assertion tantamount to an
ultimatum.</p>
<p>Then Miss Jennie seemed to think it was her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi doan&rsquo;t care fer stike.&nbsp; Hi wants
chickin,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;n&rsquo;t there
goin&rsquo; ter be no kikes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins laughed, though I strongly suspect that Thaddeus
junior would have been sent from the table had he ventured to
express a similar sentiment.&nbsp; Mrs. Bradley blushed; Bradley
looked severe; Perkins had that expression which all parents have
when other people&rsquo;s children are involved, and which
implies the thought, &ldquo;If you were mine there&rsquo;d be
trouble; but since you are not mine, how cunning you
are!&rdquo;&nbsp; But Harriet, the nurse, met the problem.&nbsp;
She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popper&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter have stike, Jinnie;
m&rsquo;yby Mr. Perkins&rsquo;ll give yer lots o&rsquo;
gryvy.&nbsp; Hit i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t time fer the kikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps I ought to say to those who have not studied dialect
as &ldquo;she is spoke&rdquo; that the word m&rsquo;yby is the
Seven Dials idiom for maybe, itself more or less an Americanism,
signifying &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; while &ldquo;kikes&rdquo; is a
controvertible term for cakes.</p>
<p>After breakfast, as a matter of course, the senior members of
both families attended divine service, then came dinner, and
after dinner the usual matching of the children began.&nbsp; The
hopefuls of Perkins were matched against the scions of
Bradley.&nbsp; All four were brought down-stairs and into the
parental presence in the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Harry is a fine fellow, Mrs. Bradley,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we think Harry is a very nice boy,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Bradley, with a fond glance at the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot djer si about me, mar?&rdquo; asked Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bradley, raising her
eyebrows reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yer did, too,&rdquo; retorted Harry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yer said as &rsquo;ow hi were a good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;e i&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, then,&rdquo;
interjected Jennie.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a
bloomin&rsquo; mean un.&nbsp; &rsquo;E took a knoife an&rsquo;
cut open me doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ush, Jinnie, &rsquo;ush!&rdquo; put in the
nurse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer tell tiles on
&rsquo;Arry.&nbsp; &rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t mean ter &rsquo;urt yer
doll.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a haxident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t a haxident,&rdquo; said
Jennie.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E done it a-purpice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wot if hi did?&rdquo; retorted Harry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t yer pull the tile off me
rockin&rsquo;-&rsquo;orse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; said Bradley, seeing how
strained things were getting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel
about it now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all done and gone, and I dare say
you were both a little to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Hi war&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Harry, and
then the subject was dropped.&nbsp; The children romped in and
out through the library and halls for some time, and the Bradleys
and Perkinses compared notes on various points of interest to
both.&nbsp; After a while they again reverted to the subject of
their children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Harry go to school?&rdquo; asked Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we think he&rsquo;s too young yet,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Bradley.&nbsp; &ldquo;He learns a little of something every
day from Harriet, who is really a very superior girl.&nbsp; She
is a good servant.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t been in this country
very long, and is English to the core, as you&rsquo;ve probably
noticed, not only in her way of comporting herself, but in her
accent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve observed it,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What does she teach him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she tells him stories that are more or less
instructive, and she reads to him.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s taught him
one or two pretty little songs&mdash;ballads, you
know&mdash;too.&nbsp; Harry has a sweet little voice.&nbsp;
Harry, dear, won&rsquo;t you sing that song about Mrs. Henry
Hawkins for mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t warn&rsquo;ter,&rdquo; said Harry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hi&rsquo;m sick o&rsquo; that bloomin&rsquo; old
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve heard it,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I remember it, Harry, it was very
pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Bradley.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
one you mean&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, &rsquo;Lizer! dear
&rsquo;Lizer!&nbsp; Mrs. &rsquo;Ennery
&rsquo;Awkins.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harry sings it well, too; but I say,
Thad, you ought to hear the nurse sing it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has the accent down fine, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of born to it, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you can&rsquo;t cultivate that accent and get it
just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do &lsquo;Dear Old Dutch&rsquo; for
yer,&rdquo; suggested Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi likes thet better
&rsquo;n &lsquo;Mrs. &rsquo;Awkins.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Harry deserted &ldquo;Mrs. &rsquo;Awkins&rdquo; and sang
that other pathetic coster-ballad, &ldquo;Dear Old Dutch,&rdquo;
and, to the credit of Harriet, the nurse, it must be said that he
was marvellously well instructed.&nbsp; It could not have been
done better had the small vocalist been the own son of a London
coster-monger instead of the scion of an American family of
refinement.</p>
<p>Thus the day passed.&nbsp; Jennie proved herself quite as
proficient in the dialect of Seven Dials as was Harry, or even
Harriet, and when she consented to stand on a chair and recite a
few nursery rhymes, there was not an unnoticed &ldquo;h&rdquo;
that she did not, sooner or later, pick up and attach to some
other word to which it was not related, as she went along.</p>
<p>In short, as far as their speech was concerned, thanks to
association with Harriet, Jennie and Harry were as perfect little
cockneys as ever ignored an aspirate.</p>
<p>The visit of the Bradleys, like all other things, came to an
end, and Bessie, Thaddeus, and the children were once more left
to themselves.&nbsp; Teddy junior, it was observed, after his day
with Harry, developed a slight tendency to misplace the letter
&ldquo;h&rdquo; in his conversation, but it was soon corrected,
and things ran smoothly as of yore.&nbsp; Only&mdash;the Only
being the natural sequence of the But referred to some time
since&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Perkins changed their minds about the
French nurse, and it came about in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie, after the Bradleys had
departed, &ldquo;what is the tile of a
rockin&rsquo;-&rsquo;orse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo; asked
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;young Harry Bradley accused Jennie of pulling out the tile
of his rockin&rsquo;-&rsquo;orse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So she did.&nbsp; I know now.&nbsp; Tile is cockney for
tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the accent those children
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All got from the nurse, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Teddy, what do you think of our getting a French
maid, after all?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think that we&rsquo;d run
a great risk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of having Ted speak&mdash;er&mdash;cockney
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Very likely,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought of that myself, and, I
guess, perhaps we&rsquo;d better stick to Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&nbsp; We can correct any tendency to a brogue,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or, if we
couldn&rsquo;t, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fatal to the boy&rsquo;s
prospects.&nbsp; It might even help him if he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help him?&nbsp; If what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he ever went into polities,&rdquo; said Perkins.</p>
<p>And that was the object-lesson which a kindly fate gave to the
Perkinses in time to prevent their engaging a French maid for the
children.</p>
<p>As to its value as a lesson, as to the value of its results,
those who are familiar with French as spoken by nurse-instructed
youths can best judge.</p>
<p>I am not unduly familiar with that or any other kind of
French, but I have ideas in the matter.</p>
<h2><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>THE
CHRISTMAS GIFTS OF THADDEUS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> you may thoroughly comprehend
how it happened that on last Christmas Day Thaddeus meted out
gifts of value so unprecedented to the domestics of what he has
come to call his &ldquo;menagerie&rdquo;&mdash;the term menage
having seemed to him totally inadequate to express the state of
affairs in his household&mdash;I must go back to the beginning of
last autumn, and narrate a few of the incidents that took place
between that period and the season of Peace on Earth and
Good-will to Men.&nbsp; Should I not do so there would be many, I
doubt not, who would deem Thaddeus&rsquo;s course unjustifiable,
especially when we are all agreed that Christmas Day should be
for all sorts and conditions of men the gladdest, happiest day of
all the year.</p>
<p>Thaddeus and Bessie and the little Thad had returned to their
attractive home after an absence of two months in a section of
the Adirondacks whither the march of civilization had not carried
such comforts as gas, good beds, and other luxuries, to which the
little family had become so accustomed that real camp-life, with
its beds of balsam, lights of tallow, and &ldquo;fried
coffee,&rdquo; possessed no charms for them.&nbsp; They were all
renewed in spirit and quite ready to embark once more upon the
troubled seas of house-keeping; and, as they saw it on that first
night at home, their crew was a most excellent one.&nbsp; The
cook rose almost to the exalted level of a chef in the estimation
of Thaddeus as course upon course, to the number of seven, each
made up of some delicacy of the season, came to the table and
received the indorsement which comes from total
consumption.&nbsp; They were well served, too, these courses; and
the two heads of the family, when Mary, the waitress, would enter
the butler&rsquo;s pantry, leaving them alone and unobserved,
nodded their satisfaction to each other across the snow-white
cloth, and by means of certain well-established signals, such as
shaking their own hands and winking the left eye simultaneously,
with an almost vicious jerk of the head, silently congratulated
themselves upon the prospects of a peaceful future in a domestic
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just the best dinner I have had in
centuries,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, as they adjourned to the library
after the meal was over.&nbsp; &ldquo;The broiled chicken was so
good, Bess, that for a moment I wished I were a bachelor again,
so that I could have it all; and after I got over my first
feeling of hesitation over the oysters, and realized that it was
September with an R&mdash;belated, it is true, but still
there&mdash;and ate six of them, I think I could have gone
down-stairs and given cook a diamond ring with seven solitaires
in it and a receipted bill for a seal-skin sacque.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see how we ever could have thought of discharging her
last June, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good dinner,&rdquo; said Bessie, discreetly
ignoring the allusion to their intentions in June; for she had a
well-defined recollection that at that time Bridget had given
signs of emotional insanity every time she was asked to prepare a
five-o&rsquo;clock breakfast for Thaddeus and his friends, to the
number of six, who had acquired the habit of going off on little
shooting trips every Saturday, making the home of Thaddeus their
headquarters over Sunday, when the game the huntsmen had bagged
the day before had to be plucked, cleaned, and cooked by her own
hands for dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it was nicely selected,
too,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes think that
I&rsquo;ll let Bridget do the ordering at the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, shaking
his head dubiously, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt that Bridget
could do it, and would be very glad to do it; but I don&rsquo;t
believe in setting a cook up in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I haven&rsquo;t any doubt that Bridget
would in a very short time become a highly successful
produce-broker with bull tendencies.&nbsp; The chicken market
would be buoyant, and the quotations on the Stock Exchange of,
say, B., S., and P.-U.-C.&mdash;otherwise, Beef, Succotash, and
Picked-Up-Codfish&mdash;would rise to the highest point in
years.&nbsp; Why, my dear, by Christmas-time cook would have our
surplus in her own pocket-book; and in the place of the customary
five oranges and an apple she would receive from the butcher a
Christmas-card in the shape of a check of massive, if not
graceful, proportions.&nbsp; No, Bess, I think the old way is the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is.&nbsp; By-the-way, John has kept the
grounds looking well, hasn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; The lawn
doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a weed on it,&rdquo; said Bessie,
walking to the window and gazing out at the soft velvety sward in
the glow of twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it looks pretty well; but there&rsquo;s a small
heap of stuff over there near the fence which rather inclines me
to believe that the weeds have been pulled out within the last
few days&mdash;in fact, since you wrote to announce our
return.&nbsp; John is an energetic man in an emergency, and I
haven&rsquo;t a doubt he has been here at least once a week ever
since we left.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep a record of John this
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the two contented home-comers talked happily along, and
when they closed their eyes in sleep that night they were, upon
the whole, very well satisfied with life.</p>
<p>Weeks elapsed, and with them some of the air-castles
collapsed.&nbsp; Whether custom staled the infinite variety of
the cook&rsquo;s virtues, and age withered the efficiency of
Mary, the waitress, or whether something was really and radically
wrong with the girls, Thaddeus and Bessie could not make
out.&nbsp; Certain it was, however, that by slow degrees the
satisfaction for which that first dinner seemed to stand as
guarantor wore away, and dissatisfaction entered the
household.&nbsp; Mary developed a fondness for church at most
inconvenient hours&mdash;hours at which in fact, neither Thaddeus
nor Bessie had ever supposed church could be.&nbsp; That it was
eternal they both knew, but they had always supposed there were
intermissions.&nbsp; Then the cook&rsquo;s family, which had
hitherto been moderately healthful, began to show signs of
invalidism, though no such calamity as actual dissolution ever
set its devastating step within the charmed circle of her
relatives.&nbsp; Cousins fell ill whom she alone could comfort;
nephews developed maladies for which she alone could care; and,
according to Thaddeus&rsquo;s record, John had been compelled on
penalty of a fine to attend the funerals of some twenty-four
deceased intimate friends in less than two months, although the
newspapers contained no mention of the existence of a possible
epidemic in the Celtic quarter.&nbsp; It is true that John showed
a more pronounced desire to make his absence less inconvenient to
his employer than did Mary and the cook, by providing a
substitute when the Ancient Order of Funereal Hibernians
compelled him to desert the post of duty; but Thaddeus declared
the &ldquo;remedy worse than the disease,&rdquo; for the reason
that John&rsquo;s substitute&mdash;his own
brother-in-law&mdash;was a weaver by trade, whose baskets the
public did not appreciate, and whose manner of cutting grass in
the early fall and of tending furnace later on was atrocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could hire that man in summer,&rdquo; Thaddeus
remarked one night when John&rsquo;s substitute had
&ldquo;fixed&rdquo; the furnace so that the library resembled a
cold-storage room, &ldquo;I think we could make this house an
arctic paradise.&nbsp; He seems to have a genius for taking
warmth by the neck and shaking enough degrees of heat out of it
to turn a conflagration into an iceberg.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll
tell the Fire Commissioners about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t compare with John,&rdquo; was
Bessie&rsquo;s answer to this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s why John sends him here
when he is off riding in carriages in honor of his deceased
chums.&nbsp; By the side of Dennis, John is a jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John is very faithful with the furnace,&rdquo; said
Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never lets it go down.&nbsp; Why, day
before yesterday I turned off every register in the house, and
even then had to open all the windows to keep from
suffocating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t all John, my dear,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Weather Bureau had something to do
with it.&nbsp; It was a warm day for this season of the year,
anyhow.&nbsp; If John could combine the two businesses of selling
coal and feeding furnaces, I think he would become a
millionaire.&nbsp; And, by-the-way, I think you ought to speak to
him, Bess, about the windows.&nbsp; Since you gave him the work
of window-cleaning to do, it is evident that he thinks I have
nothing to say in the matter, for he persistently ignores my
requests that he clean them in squares as they are made, and not
rub up a little circle in the middle, so that they look like
blocks of opalescent glass with plate-glass bulls&rsquo;-eyes let
into the centre.&nbsp; Look at them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dennis did that.&nbsp; John had to go to Mount Vernon
with his militia company to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dennis is well named, for his name is&mdash;But never
mind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll credit John with his twelfth day off in
four weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From John to Bridget, in the matter of days off, was an easy
step, though such was Bessie&rsquo;s consummate diplomacy that
Thaddeus would probably have continued in ignorance of the extent
to which Bridget absented herself had they not both taken
occasion one day to visit some relatives in Philadelphia, and on
their return home at night found no dinner awaiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus, a
little crossly, perhaps, for visiting relatives in Philadelphia
irritated him&mdash;possibly because he and they did not agree in
politics, and their assumption that Thaddeus&rsquo;s party was
entirely made up of the ignorant and self-seeking was galling to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t dinner ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary says that an hour after we left cook got a
telegram from New York saying that her brother was dying, and she
had to go right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that brother was dying last week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that was her mother&rsquo;s brother, he got
well.&nbsp; This is another person entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; snapped Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
next time we get a cook let&rsquo;s have one whose relatives are
all dead, or in the old country, where they can&rsquo;t be
reached.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you shouldn&rsquo;t be cross with me about it,
Thad,&rdquo; said Bessie, with a teary look in her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have to put up with a great deal more of it than you
have, only you never know of it.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve cooked
one-half of my own luncheons in the last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dinners, too, I&rsquo;ll wager,&rdquo; growled
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she&rsquo;s always got home for dinner
heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll keep a record-book for her, too,
then.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll be generous with her.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll allow her just as I was allowed in
college&mdash;twenty-five per cent. in cuts.&nbsp; If she has
twenty-five and a fifth per cent. she goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand,&rdquo; said
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll put it this way: There are thirty
days in a month.&nbsp; That means ninety meals a month.&nbsp; If
she cooks sixty-seven and a half of them she can stay; if she
fails to cook the other twenty-two and a half she can stay; but
woe be unto her if she slips up by even so little as a millionth
part of the sixty-eighth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can manage the half part of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave that to her,&rdquo; said Thaddeus,
firmly; &ldquo;and, what is more, we&rsquo;ll put John and Mary
on the same basis, and Dennis we won&rsquo;t have on any basis at
all.&nbsp; A man who will take advantage of his brother&rsquo;s
absence at a wake to black the shoes of that brother&rsquo;s only
employer with stove-polish is not the kind of a man I want to
have around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a very good plan,&rdquo; said Bessie,
&ldquo;for all except Mary.&nbsp; Her absences she cannot well
avoid.&nbsp; She has to go to church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times a week does she have to go?&rdquo;
queried Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is required to go to confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let her reform, and then she&rsquo;ll have
nothing to go to confession for.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
that&rsquo;s where she goes, either.&nbsp; I notice that one-half
those evenings she takes off, permitting me to mind the front
door, and enabling us both to acquire proficiency in the art of
helping ourselves at dinner, there&rsquo;s a fireman&rsquo;s ball
or a policeman&rsquo;s hop or a letter-carriers&rsquo; theatre
party going on somewhere in the county, and it&rsquo;s my belief
the worshipping she does on these occasions is at the shrine of
Terpsichore or that of Melpomene, which is a heathen custom and
not to be tolerated here.&nbsp; If she&rsquo;s so fond of living
in church we can quote to her Hamlet&rsquo;s advice to
Ophelia&mdash;&lsquo;Get thee to a nunnery!&rsquo;&nbsp; Why,
Bess, I was mortified to death the other night when Bradley dined
here, he&rsquo;s all the time bragging about his menagerie, and I
tried to bluff him out and make him believe we were waited on by
angels in disguise, and you know what happened.&nbsp; He came,
saw, and I was regularly knocked out.&nbsp; You let us in; we
waited on ourselves; cook had prepared the seven-o&rsquo;clock
dinner at five to give her a chance to go to the hospital to see
her brother-in-law with the measles; John had one of his
Central-African fires on, and Bradley&rsquo;s laughing about it
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bradley was very disagreeable the other night,
anyhow,&rdquo; sniffed Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;He acted as if he
were camping out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t honestly say I blame him for
that,&rdquo; retorted Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;It only needed a
balsam bed and a hole in the roof to let the rain in on him to
complete the illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, December came, and the tendencies of absenteeism on
the part of the servants showed no signs of abatement.&nbsp; They
were remonstrated with, but it made no difference.&nbsp; They
didn&rsquo;t go out, they declared, because they wanted to, but
because they had to.&nbsp; Cook couldn&rsquo;t let her relatives
go unattended.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s religious scruples simply
dragged her out of the house, try as she would to stay in; and as
for John, as long as Dennis was on hand to take his place he
couldn&rsquo;t see why Mr. Perkins was dissatisfied.&nbsp; To
tell the truth, John had recently imbibed some more or less
capitalistic&mdash;or anticapitalistic&mdash;doctrines, and he
was quite incapable of understanding why, if a street-contractor,
for instance, was permitted by the laws of the land to sublet the
work for which he had contracted, he, John, should not be
permitted to sublet his contract to Dennis, piecemeal, or even as
a whole, if he saw fit to do so.</p>
<p>Thaddeus, seeing that Bessie was very much upset by the
condition of affairs, had said little about it since Thanksgiving
Day, when he had said about as much as the subject warranted
after a six-course dinner had been hurried through in one hour,
two courses having been omitted that Bridget might catch the
train leaving for New York at 3.10.&nbsp; Nor would he have said
anything further than the final words of dismissal had he not
come home late one afternoon to dress for a dinner at his club,
when he discovered that, owing to the usual causes, the
week&rsquo;s wash, which the combined efforts of cook and
waitress should have finished that day, was delayed twenty-four
hours, the consequence being that Thaddeus had to telephone to
the haberdashery for a dress-shirt and collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough having one&rsquo;s wife buy these
things for one, but when it comes to having a salesman sell you
over a telephone the style of shirt and collar &lsquo;he always
wears himself,&rsquo; it is maddening,&rdquo; began Thaddeus, and
then he went on at such an outrageous rate that Bessie became
hysterical, and Thaddeus&rsquo;s conscience would not permit of
his going out at all that night, and that was the beginning of
the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em at Christmas-time,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget them at Christmas, I hope,
Thad,&rdquo; said Bessie, whose forgiving nature would not hear
of anything so ungenerous as forgetting the servants during the
holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
forget &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em all the very
things they like best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; smiled Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the
coals-of-fire principle.&nbsp; Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but
it would work admirably.&nbsp; Perhaps they&rsquo;ll be so
ashamed they&rsquo;ll do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if the coals do not burn too deep,&rdquo;
said Thaddeus, with a significant smile.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve arrived, and little Thad&rsquo;s tree was
dressed, the gifts were arranged beneath it, and all seemed in
readiness for the dawning of the festal day, when Bessie, taking
a mental inventory of the packages and discovering nothing among
them for the servants save her own usual contribution of a dress
and a pair of gloves for each, turned and said to Thaddeus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the hot coals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coals of fire for the girls and John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Thaddeus replied, &ldquo;I have &rsquo;em in
the library.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll go well with
the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; queried Bess, with a natural show
of curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Checks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, partly,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary is
to have a check for $16, Bridget one for $18, and John one for
$40.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Thaddeus, that&rsquo;s extravagant.&nbsp; Now, my
dear, there&rsquo;s no use of your doing anything of
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Teddy!&rdquo; Bessie remonstrated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Those are the amounts of their wages.&nbsp; You will spoil
them, and if I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, wait, Bess, wait!&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand the whole
scheme to-morrow, after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did, and when she did she almost wished for a moment
that she didn&rsquo;t, for after breakfast Thaddeus summoned the
three offenders into his presence, and the effect was not
altogether free from painful features to the forgiving Bess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridget,&rdquo; Thaddeus said, &ldquo;do you remember
what Mrs. Perkins gave you last Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; replied Bridget, rather
uncompromisingly; for it was a matter of history that she thought
Mrs. Perkins on the last Christmas festival had shown signs of
parsimony in giving her a calico gown instead of one of silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t forget next year what you got
this,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is an
envelope containing $18, the amount of your wages until January
1st.&nbsp; Mary, what did you get last Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A box of candy, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there was a dress of some kind.&nbsp; I gave
it to my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; I am glad you were so generous.&nbsp; Here
is an envelope for you.&nbsp; It has $16 in it, your wages up to
January 1st.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bessie stood in the doorway, a mute witness to what seemed to
her an incomprehensible scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, what did you get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars an&rsquo; a day off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a two-dollar bill for Dennis, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dennis got that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&nbsp; Well, John, here&rsquo;s $40 for
you&mdash;that pays you until January 1st.&nbsp; Now, it strikes
me that, considering the behavior of you three people, I am very
generous to pay you your wages a week in advance, but I am not
going to stop there.&nbsp; I have studied you all very carefully,
and I&rsquo;ve tried to discover what it is you are fondest
of.&nbsp; Cook and Mary do not seem to care much for dresses,
though I believe there are dresses and gloves under the tree for
them, which fact they will doubtless forget by next Christmas
Day.&nbsp; The five dollars and a day off John seems to remember,
though from his manner of recalling it I do not think his
remembrance is a very pleasing one.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve found
out what it is you all like the best, and I&rsquo;m going to give
it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the trio endeavored to appear gracious, though they were
manifestly uneasy and a bit dissatisfied with what John would
have called &ldquo;the luks of t&rsquo;ings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cook, from the 1st of January, may go to her relatives,
and stay until they&rsquo;re every one of them restored to
health, if it takes forty years.&nbsp; Mary may consider herself
presented with sixty years&rsquo; vacation without pay; and for
you, John, I have written this letter of recommendation to the
proprietors of a large undertaking establishment in New York, who
will, I trust, engage you as a chief mourner, or perhaps
hearse-driver, for the balance of your days.&nbsp; At any rate,
you, too, after January 1st, may consider yourself free to go to
any funeral or militia exercises, or anything else you may choose
to honor with your presence, at your own expense.&nbsp; You are
all given leave of absence without pay until further
notice.&nbsp; I wish you a merry Christmas.&nbsp;
Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no farewells in the house that day; and inasmuch as
there was no Christmas dinner either, Thaddeus and Bessie did not
miss the service of the waitress, who, when last seen, was
walking airily off towards the station, accompanied by the
indignant John and a bundle-laden cook.&nbsp; Next day their
trunks went also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rather a hard thing to do on Christmas Day,
Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie, a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; quibbled Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
very easy under the circumstances, and quite appropriate.&nbsp;
This is the time of peace on earth and good-will to men.&nbsp;
The only way for us to have peace on earth was to get rid of
those two women; and as for John, he has my good-will, now that
he is no longer in my employ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>A
STRANGE BANQUET</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thaddeus</span>,&rdquo; said Bessie
to her husband as they sat at breakfast one morning, shortly
after the royal banquet over which &ldquo;Grimmins&rdquo; had
presided, &ldquo;did you hear anything strange in the house last
night?&nbsp; Something like a footstep in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I slept like a
top last night.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear anything.&nbsp; Did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;About
two o&rsquo;clock I waked up with a start, and while it may have
been a sort of waking dream, I was almost certain I heard a
rustling sound out in the hall, and immediately after a creaking
on the stairs, as though there was somebody there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why on earth didn&rsquo;t you wake me,
Bess?&rdquo; returned Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could easily have
decided the matter by getting up and investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was why I didn&rsquo;t wake you, Teddy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d a great deal rather lose the silver or anything else in
the house a burglar might want than have you hit on the head with
a sand-club,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You men are too
brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, with a smile, as he
thought of a certain discussion he had had not long before at the
club, in which he and several other brave men had reached the
unanimous conclusion that the best thing to do at dead of night,
with burglars in the house, was to crawl down under the
bedclothes and snore as loudly as possible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless, my dear, you should have told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will next time,&rdquo; said Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was anything in the house disturbed?&rdquo; Thaddeus
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a thing, as
far as I can find out.&nbsp; Mary says that everything was all
right when she came down, and the cook apparently found things
straight, because she hasn&rsquo;t said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Thaddeus and Bessie made up their minds that the latter had
been dreaming, and that nothing was wrong.&nbsp; Two or three
days later, however, they changed their minds on the
subject.&nbsp; There was something decidedly wrong, but what it
was they could not discover.&nbsp; They were both awakened by a
rustling sound in the hallway, outside of their room, and this
time there was a creak on the stairs that was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Thaddeus,&rdquo; said Bessie, in a
terrified whisper, as Thaddeus made a brave effort to get up and
personally investigate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have you
hurt for all the world, and there isn&rsquo;t a thing down-stairs
they can take that we can&rsquo;t afford to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus felt very much as Bessie did, and it would have
pleased him much better to lie quietly where he was than run the
risk of an encounter with thieves.&nbsp; He had been brave enough
in the company of men to advocate cowardice in an emergency of
just this sort, but now that this same course was advocated by
his wife, he saw it in a different light.&nbsp; Prudence was
possible, cowardice was not.&nbsp; He must get up, and get up he
did; but before going out of his room he secured his revolver,
which had lain untouched and unloaded in his bureau-drawer for
two years, and then advanced cautiously to the head of the stairs
and listened&mdash;Bessie meanwhile having buried her face in her
pillow as a possible means of assuaging her fears.&nbsp; It is
singular what a soothing effect a soft feather pillow sometimes
has upon the agitated nerves if the nose of the agitated person
is thrust far enough into its yielding surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; cried Thaddeus, standing at the
head of the stairs, his knees all of a shake, but whether from
fear or from cold, as an admirer of Thaddeus I prefer not to
state.</p>
<p>Apparently the stage-whisper in which this challenge to a
possible burglar was uttered rendered it unavailing, for there
was no reply; but that there was some one below who could reply
Thaddeus was now convinced, for there were sounds in the
library&mdash;sounds, however, suggestive of undue attention to
domestic duties rather than of that which fate has mapped out for
house-breakers.&nbsp; The library floor was apparently being
swept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the biggest idiot of a burglar I&rsquo;ve
ever heard of,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, returning to his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wha-what, d-dud-dear?&rdquo; mumbled Mrs. Perkins,
burying her ear in the pillow for comfort now that she was
compelled to take her nose away so that she might talk
intelligibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that burglar must be an idiot,&rdquo; repeated
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you suppose he is doing
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wha-what, d-dud-dear?&rdquo; asked Bessie,
apparently unable to think of any formula other than this in
speaking, since this was the second time she had used it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sweeping the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must not go down,&rdquo; cried Bessie, sitting
up, and losing her fear for a moment in her anxiety for her
husband&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;A burglar you might manage,
but a maniac&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, Bess,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Perkins, with equal firmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Bess, don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; returned
Thaddeus, his face assuming a graver expression than his wife had
ever seen there.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my work, and it is none of
yours.&nbsp; I positively forbid you to stir out of this
room.&nbsp; I shall be very careful, and you need have no concern
for me.&nbsp; I shall go down the backstairs and around by the
porch, and peep in through the library window first.&nbsp; The
moonlight will be sufficient to enable me to see all that is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; acquiesced Bessie, &ldquo;only do be
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus donned his long bath-robe, put on his slippers, and
started to descend.&nbsp; The stairs were so dark that he could
with difficulty proceed&mdash;and perhaps it was just as well for
Thaddeus that they were.&nbsp; If there had been light enough for
him to see two great glaring eyes that stared at him through that
darkness out from the passageway at the foot of the stairs, upon
which he turned his back when he went out upon the porch, it is
not unlikely that a very serious climax to his strange experience
would have been reached then and there.&nbsp; As it was, he saw
nothing, but kept straight ahead, stepped noiselessly out upon
the piazza, crept stealthily along in the soft light of the moon,
until he reached the library window.&nbsp; There he stopped and
listened.&nbsp; All was still within&mdash;so still that the
beating of his heart seemed like the hammering of a sledge upon
an anvil by contrast.&nbsp; Then, raising himself cautiously upon
his toes, he peered through the window into the room, the greater
part of which was made visible by the wealth of the moon&rsquo;s
light streaming into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Thaddeus, after he had directed his
searching gaze into every corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
anybody there at all.&nbsp; Most incomprehensible thing I ever
heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he walked back to the piazza door, and went thence
boldly into the library and lit the gas.&nbsp; His piazza
observations were then verified, for the room was devoid of life,
save for Thaddeus&rsquo;s own presence; but upon the floor before
the hearth was a broom, and there were evidences also that the
sweeping sounds he had heard had been caused by no less an
instrument than this, for in the corner of the fireplace was a
heap of dust, cigar ashes, and scraps of paper, which Thaddeus
remembered had been upon the hearth in greater or less quantity
when he had turned out the gas to retire a few hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a serious matter,&rdquo; he said to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something is wrong, and I doubt if there
have been burglars in the house; but I can ascertain that without
trouble.&nbsp; If the doors and windows are all secure the
trouble is internal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every accessible door and window on the basement and first
floor was examined, and, with the exception of the piazza door,
which Thaddeus remembered to have unlocked himself a few minutes
before, every lock was fastened.&nbsp; The disturbance had come
from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bess must never know it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it
would worry her to death.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then came a thought to
Thaddeus&rsquo;s mind that almost stopped the beating of his
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless she has discovered it in my
absence,&rdquo; he gasped.&nbsp; In an instant he was mounting
the stairs to hasten to Bessie&rsquo;s side, as though some
terrible thing were pursuing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was it, Ted?&rdquo; she asked, as he entered
the room.</p>
<p>Perkins gave a sigh of relief.&nbsp; All was safe enough
above-stairs at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, in a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no one below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, &ldquo;unless it was a stray cat in the house.&nbsp;
The sweeping sound may have been caused by a cat scratching its
collar&mdash;or purring&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;something.&nbsp;
At any rate, things appear to be all right, my dear, so
let&rsquo;s go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus&rsquo;s assumed confidence in the rightness of
everything, rather than his explanations, was convincing to Mrs.
Perkins, and in a very short while she was sleeping the sleep of
the just and serene; but to Thaddeus&rsquo;s eye there came no
more sleep that night, and when morning came he rose
unrefreshed.&nbsp; There were two problems confronting him.&nbsp;
The first was to solve the mystery of the swept library floor;
the second was to do this without arousing his wife&rsquo;s
suspicions that anything was wrong.&nbsp; To do the first he
deemed it necessary to remain at home that day, which was easy,
for Thaddeus was more or less independent of office-work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not going down,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Perkins, when he announced his intention of remaining at
home.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be able to make up for your loss of
sleep last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
only thing I can do, I&rsquo;m so played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast passed off pleasantly in spite of a great
drawback&mdash;the steak was burned almost to a crisp, and the
fried potatoes were like chips of wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret seems to be unfamiliar with the art of cooking
this morning,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
steak is horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst part of it is,&rdquo; said Thaddeus,
&ldquo;she has erred on the wrong side.&nbsp; If the steak were
underdone it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it a
pity Edison can&rsquo;t invent a machine to rarefy an overdone
steak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a fine idea,&rdquo; smiled Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And to take a Saratoga chip and make it less like a chip
off a granite block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the potatoes so much,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can break them up in a bowl of milk and
secure a gastronomic novelty that, suitably seasoned, isn&rsquo;t
at all bad, but the steak is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she heard that cat last night, and thought it was
a burglar, just as we did,&rdquo; Bessie suggested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t account for a breakfast like this in any
other way, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, shortly, and then he had an
idea; and when Thaddeus had an idea he was apt to become
extremely reticent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Thad!&rdquo; thought Bessie, as she noted his
sudden change of demeanor.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t stand loss
of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning was spent by Thaddeus in the &ldquo;noble pastime
of snooping,&rdquo; as he called it.&nbsp; The house was searched
by him in a casual sort of way from top to bottom for a clew to
the mystery, but without avail.&nbsp; Several times he went below
to the cellar, ostensibly to inspect his coal supply, really to
observe the demeanor of Margaret, the cook.&nbsp; Barring an
unusual pallor upon her cheek, she appeared to be as she always
had been; but with the waitress it was different.&nbsp; Mary was
evidently excited over something, but over what Thaddeus could
not, of course, determine at that time.&nbsp; Later in the day,
however, the cause of her perturbation came out, and
Thaddeus&rsquo;s effort to keep Bessie from anxiety over the
occurrence of the night before was rendered unavailing.&nbsp; It
was at luncheon.&nbsp; The table was set in a most peculiar
fashion.&nbsp; The only china upon it was from an old set which
had been discarded a year previous to the time of this story, and
Bessie naturally wanted to know why, and the waitress broke
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s all we have,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she, her eyes filling with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we have?&rdquo; echoed Mrs. Perkins in
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&nbsp; Where is the
other set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; protested the waitress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; said Thaddeus, taking the
matter in hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t the china a part of your care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the maid,
&ldquo;but&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone, sir, and I don&rsquo;t know
where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you miss it?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I came to set the table for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it in its proper place at
breakfast-time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice, sir.&nbsp; The breakfast dishes
were all there, but I don&rsquo;t remember seeing the other
plates.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t a cat,&rdquo; said Bessie, sinking
back into her chair; &ldquo;we have been robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the first time on record, I guess,
that thieves have ever robbed a man of his china,&rdquo; said
Thaddeus, calmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you looked for the
plates?&rdquo; he added, addressing the waitress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied, simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
could I look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;where?&rdquo; said Bessie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much use looking for dishes when they
disappear like that.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t like whisk-brooms or
button-hooks to be mislaid easily.&nbsp; We have been robbed;
that&rsquo;s all there is about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s eat
lunch, and see about it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quite easy to say, but to eat under the circumstances
was too much for either of the young householders.&nbsp; The
luncheon left the table practically untouched; and when it was
over Thaddeus called his man into the house, wrote a note to the
police-station, asking for an officer in citizen&rsquo;s clothes
at once, and despatched it by him, with the injunction to let
very little grass grow under his feet on the way down to
headquarters.&nbsp; He then summoned the waitress into the
library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you said anything to Margaret about the
china?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her as how wasn&rsquo;t it funny the way it had
went, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir.&nbsp; Only she seemed to think it was
funny, because she laughed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Mr. Perkins.&nbsp; Margaret and me have very
little conversation, because she don&rsquo;t fancy me, and
prefers talkin&rsquo; to herself like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talks to
herself, does she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time, sir,&rdquo; returned the waitress,
&ldquo;and she seems very fond of it, sir.&nbsp; She laughs, and
says things, and then laughs again.&nbsp; She does it by the
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has this been going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a week, sir.&nbsp; I noticed it first last time I
had my day out.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get in until nearly eleven
o&rsquo;clock, and I found her sitting at the table havin&rsquo;
supper and talkin&rsquo; and laughin&rsquo; like as though there
was folks around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was entirely alone, was she?&rdquo; asked
Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do when you came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;Hello&rsquo; to her and sat down opposite
to her at the table, where there was a place set, and I told her
I was glad she had something to eat and a place set for me,
because I hadn&rsquo;t had any supper and I was hungry,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she make any reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; She looked at me kind of indignant, and
turned out the gas and went up to bed, leaving me in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus&rsquo;s brow grew thoughtful again.&nbsp; It wrinkled
into a half-dozen lines as he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you speak of this before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for me to be telling tales, Mr.
Perkins,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;All cooks as I&rsquo;ve
lived with is queer like, and I didn&rsquo;t think any more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may
go.&nbsp; Only, Mary, don&rsquo;t speak of the plates again to
Margaret.&nbsp; Say as little to her as you can, in fact, about
anything.&nbsp; If you notice anything queer, report to me at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waitress left the room, and Thaddeus turned to his
desk.&nbsp; It was plain from his appearance that light was
beginning to be let in on places that up to this point had been
more or less dark to him, although, as a matter of fact, he could
not in any way account for the mystery of the vanished plates any
more than he could for the sweeping of the library in the still
hours of the night.&nbsp; He had an idea as to who the culprit
was, and what that idea was is plain enough to us, but the
question of motive was the great puzzle to him now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she did take them, why should she?&rdquo; was the
problem he was trying to solve; and then, as if his trials were
not already great enough for one day, Bessie broke excitedly into
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thaddeus!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
something wrong in this house; my best table-cloth is missing,
our dessert-spoons are gone, and what do you suppose has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;a volcano has developed in the
cellar, I suppose,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t as bad as
that; but the ice-cream man has telephoned up to know whether we
want the cream for dinner or for eleven o&rsquo;clock, according
to the order as he understands it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
anything very unusual in an ice-cream man&rsquo;s needing to be
told three or four times what is expected of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never ordered any cream at all,&rdquo; said
Bessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
different.&nbsp; Did you tell Partinelli so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, and he said he was sure he wasn&rsquo;t
mistaken, because he had taken the order himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, from Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Thaddeus;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a clew that fits very nicely into my theory of
our recent household disturbances.&nbsp; If you will wait, I
think things will begin to develop very shortly, and then we
shall be able to dismiss this indictment against the cat we
thought we heard last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Margaret is dishonest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she had friends with
taking ways; in other words, my dear, I suspect that Margaret is
in league with people outside of this house who profit by her
mistaken notions as to how to be generous; but I can&rsquo;t
prove it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set a watch.&nbsp; I have sent for a detective,&rdquo;
said Thaddeus.</p>
<p>This was too much for Bessie.&nbsp; She was simply overcome,
and she sat squarely down upon the arm-chair, which fortunately
was immediately behind her.&nbsp; I think that if it had not
been, she would have plumped down upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, &ldquo;and here he
comes,&rdquo; he added, as a carriage was driven up to the door
and one of the citizen police descended therefrom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would better leave us to talk over this matter
together,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, as he hastened to the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall be able to manage it entirely, and the details
might make you nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more nervous than I am,&rdquo; said
Bessie; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll leave you just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon she went to her room, and Thaddeus, for an hour, was
closeted with the detective, to which he detailed the whole
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the two,&rdquo; said the latter, when
Thaddeus had finished, &ldquo;and I agree with you it is more
likely to be the cook than the waitress.&nbsp; If it was the
waitress, she couldn&rsquo;t have stood your examination as well
as you say she did.&nbsp; Perhaps I&rsquo;d better see her,
though, and talk to her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Thaddeus
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pass you off as a business acquaintance of
mine up from town, and you can stay all night and watch
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged.&nbsp; The detective was introduced into
the family as a correspondent of Thaddeus&rsquo;s firm, and he
settled down to watch the household.&nbsp; Afternoon and evening
went by without developments, and at about eleven o&rsquo;clock
every light in the house was extinguished, and the whole family,
from the head of the house to the cook, had apparently
retired.</p>
<p>At half-past eleven, however, there were decided signs of life
within the walls of Thaddeus&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; The clew was
working satisfactorily, and the complete revelation of the
mystery was close at hand.</p>
<p>The remainder of the narrative can best be told in the words
of the detective:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mr. Perkins sent for me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and told me all that had happened, I made up my mind that
he had a servant in his house for whom the police had been on the
lookout for some time.&nbsp; I thought she was a certain Helen
Malony, alias Bridget O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, alias many other
names, who was nothing more nor less than the agent of a clever
band of thieves who had lifted thousands of dollars of swag in
the line of household silver, valuable books, diamonds, and other
things from private houses, where she had been employed in
various capacities.&nbsp; I could not understand why she should
have made &rsquo;way with the dishes and Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s
table-cloth, but there&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes of people
in that line of business, so I didn&rsquo;t bother much trying to
reason that matter out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we&rsquo;d had dinner and spent the evening in
Mr. Perkins&rsquo;s library, the family went to bed, and I
pretended to do the same.&nbsp; Instead of really going to bed, I
waited my chance and slipped down the stairs into the
dining-room, and got under the table.&nbsp; At eleven
o&rsquo;clock the maidservants went up to their rooms, and at
quarter-past there wasn&rsquo;t a light burning in the
house.&nbsp; I sat there in the dining-room waiting, and just as
the clock struck half-past eleven I heard a noise out on the
stairs, and in less than half a minute a sulphur match was struck
almost over my head under the table, and there stood the cook,
her face livid as that of a dead person, and in her hand she held
a candle, which she lit with the match.&nbsp; From where I was I
could see everything she did, which was not much.&nbsp; She
simply gathered up all the table fixings she could, and started
down-stairs into the kitchen with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Then I went up
to Mr. Perkins&rsquo;s room and called him.&nbsp; He put on his
clothes and got out his revolver, when we stole down-stairs
together, leaving Mrs. Perkins up-stairs, with her boy&rsquo;s
nurse and the waitress to keep her company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a second we were in the laundry, which was as dark
as the ace of spades, except where the light from four gas-jets
in the kitchen streamed in through the half-open door.&nbsp; Mr.
Perkins was for pouncing in on the cook at once, but I was after
the rest of the gang as much as I was for the cook, and I
persuaded him to wait; and, by thunder, we were paid for
waiting.&nbsp; It was the queerest case I ever had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman&mdash;looking for all the world like a
creature from some other part of the universe than this earth,
her eyes burning like two huge coals, her checks as yellow and
clear as so much wax, and her lips blue-white, with a great
flaming red tongue sort of laid between them&mdash;worked like a
slave cleaning the floor, polishing the range, and scrubbing the
table.&nbsp; Then she dusted all the chairs, and, producing the
missing table-cloth, she laid it snow-white upon the table.&nbsp;
In two minutes more the lost china was brought to light out of
the flour-barrel, polished off, and set upon the
table&mdash;enough for twenty people.&nbsp; The dining-room
things I had seen her take she arranged as tastefully as any one
could want, and then the finest lay-out in the way of salads,
cakes, fruits, and other good things I ever saw was brought in
from the cellar.&nbsp; To do all this took a marvellously short
time.&nbsp; It was five minutes of midnight went she got through,
and then she devoted three minutes to looking after
herself.&nbsp; She whisked out a small hand-glass and touched up
her hair a bit.&nbsp; Then she washed her hands and pinned some
roses on her dress, smiled a smile I can never forget in my life,
and opened the kitchen door and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s going to give a supper!&rsquo;
whispered Mr. Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It looks like it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And a mighty fine one at that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute she came back with a pail, in which were
four bottles of champagne, in her hand.&nbsp; This she took into
the cellar, returning to the kitchen as the clock struck
twelve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the queerest part began,&rdquo; said the
detective.&nbsp; &ldquo;For ten minutes by the clock people were
apparently arriving, though, as far as Mr. Perkins or I could
see, there wasn&rsquo;t a soul in the kitchen besides
Margaret.&nbsp; She was talking away like one possessed.&nbsp;
Every once in a while she&rsquo;d stop in the middle of a
sentence and rush to the door and shake hands with some, to us
invisible, arrival.&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;d walk in with them
chatting and laughing.&nbsp; Several times she went through the
motion of taking people&rsquo;s hats, and finally, if we could
judge from her actions, she had &rsquo;em all seated at the
table.&nbsp; She passed salads all around, helping each guest
herself.&nbsp; She sent them fruit and cakes, and then she
brought out the wine, which she distributed in the same
fashion.&nbsp; She also apologized because some ice-cream she had
ordered hadn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the invisible guests appeared to have had all they
could eat, she began the chatty part again, and never seemed to
be disturbed but once, when she requested some one not to sing so
loud for fear of disturbing the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether it was the weirdest and rummest thing
I&rsquo;d ever seen in my life.&nbsp; We watched it for one full
hour, and then we quit because she did.&nbsp; At one
o&rsquo;clock she apparently bade her guests good-night, after
which she gathered up and put away all the eatables there were
left&mdash;and, of course, everything but what she had eaten
herself still remained&mdash;cleaned all the dishes, restored
them to their proper places in the dining-room pantry, and went
back up-stairs to her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Perkins and I didn&rsquo;t know what to make of
it.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a thing stolen, and it was clear to
my mind that I&rsquo;d done the woman an injustice in connecting
her with thieves.&nbsp; She was honest, except in so far as she
had ordered all those salads and creams and things from time to
time on Mr. Perkins&rsquo;s account, which was easy enough for
her to do, since Mrs. Perkins let her do the ordering.&nbsp;
There was only one explanation of the matter.&nbsp; She was
crazy, and I said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I fancy you are right,&rsquo; said Mr.
Perkins.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have to send her to an
asylum!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the thing,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and we&rsquo;d better do it the first thing in the
morning.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t tackle her to-night, because
she&rsquo;s probably excited, and like as not would make a great
deal of trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;was where
Mr. Perkins and I made our mistake.&nbsp; Next morning she
wasn&rsquo;t to be found, and to this day I haven&rsquo;t heard a
word of her.&nbsp; She disappeared just like that,&rdquo; he
said, snapping his fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t
mean to say that anything supernatural occurred.&nbsp; She simply
must have slipped down and out while we were asleep.&nbsp; The
front door was wide open in the morning, and a woman answering to
her description was seen to leave the Park station, five miles
from the Perkins house, on the six-thirty train that
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have no idea where she is now?&rdquo; I asked
of the detective, when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not the slightest.&nbsp;
For all I know she may be cooking for you at this very
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which comforting remark he left me.</p>
<p>For my part, I hope the detective was wrong.&nbsp; If I
thought there was a possibility of Margaret&rsquo;s ever being
queen of my culinary department, I should either give up
house-keeping at once and join some simple community where every
man is his own chef, or dine forevermore on canned goods.</p>

181</span>JANE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was quite the reverse of
beautiful&mdash;to some she was positively unpleasant to look
upon; but that made no difference to Mrs. Thaddeus Perkins, who,
after long experience with domestics, had come to judge of the
value of a servant by her performance rather than by her
appearance.&nbsp; The girl&mdash;if girl she were, for she might
have been thirty or sixty, so far as any one could judge from a
merely superficial glance at her face and figure&mdash;was neat
of aspect, and, what was more, she had come well
recommended.&nbsp; She bore upon her face every evidence of
respectability and character, as well as one or two lines which
might have indicated years or toothache&mdash;it was difficult to
decide which.&nbsp; On certain days, when the weather was very
warm and she had much to do, the impression was that the lines
meant years, and many of them, accentuated as they were by her
pallor, the whiteness of her face making the lines seem almost
black in their intensity.&nbsp; When she smiled, however, which
she rarely did&mdash;she was solemn enough to have been a
butler&mdash;one was impressed with the idea of hours of pain
from a wicked tooth.&nbsp; At any rate, she was engaged as
waitress, and put in charge of the first floor of the Perkins
household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy we&rsquo;ve at last got a real treasure,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no nonsense about
Jane&mdash;I think.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last two words were added
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get her?&rdquo; asked Thaddeus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At an Imbecility Office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you mean&mdash;an
Imbecility Office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my pet, private, and particular name for it, my
dear.&nbsp; You would speak of it as an Intelligence Office, no
doubt,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;My observation of the
fruit of Intelligence Offices has convinced me that they deal in
Imbecility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They look after Domestic Vacancies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they do it with a vengeance,&rdquo; said
Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had more vacancies in this
house to do our cooking and our laundering and our house-work
generally than two able-bodied men could shake sticks at.&nbsp;
It seems to me that the domestic servant of to-day is fonder of
preoccupation than of occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, I think, is different from the general
run,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I said, she has no
nonsense about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she&mdash;an&mdash;an ornament to the
scene&mdash;pretty, and all that?&rdquo; asked Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the reverse,&rdquo; replied the little
house-keeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is as plain as a&mdash;as
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say hedge-fence and be done with it,&rdquo; said
Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the use of providing a good dinner for your friends if they are
going to spend all their time looking at the waitress?&nbsp; When
I give a dinner it makes me tired to have the men afterwards
speak of the waitress rather than of the <i>pur&eacute;e</i> or
the birds.&nbsp; If any domestic is to dominate the repast at all
it should be the cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Service counts for a great deal, though, Ted,&rdquo;
suggested Mrs. Perkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Thaddeus; &ldquo;but on the whole,
when I am starving, give me a <i>filet b&eacute;arnaise</i>
served by a sailor, rather than an empty plate brought in in
style by a butler of illustrious lineage and impressive
manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he added: &ldquo;I hope she isn&rsquo;t
too homely, Bess&mdash;not a &lsquo;clock-stopper,&rsquo; as the
saying is.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want people&rsquo;s appetites
taken away when you&rsquo;ve worked for hours on a menu
calculated to tickle the palates of your guests.&nbsp; Would her
homeliness&mdash;ah&mdash;efface itself, for instance, in the
presence of a culinary creation, or is it likely to overshadow
everything with its ineffaceable completeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Perkins;
&ldquo;especially with your friends, who, it seems to me, would
one and all insist upon finishing a &lsquo;creation,&rsquo; as
you call it, even if lightning should strike the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that point of view,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that Jane will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jane came, and for a year, strange to relate, was all that
her references claimed for her.&nbsp; She was neat, clean, and
capable.&nbsp; She was sober and industrious.&nbsp; The wine had
never been better served; the dinner had rarely come to the table
so hot.&nbsp; Had she been a butler of the first magnitude she
could not so have discouraged the idea of acquaintance; her
attraction, if anything, was a combination of her self-effacement
and her ugliness.&nbsp; The latter might have been noticed as she
entered the dining-room; it was soon forgotten in the
unconsciously observed ease with which she went through her
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Perkins, after a dinner
of twelve covers served by Jane with a pantry assistant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a sneaking notion that nothing short
of a butler could satisfy me, but now I think otherwise.&nbsp;
Jane is perfection, and there is nothing paralyzing about her, as
there is about most of those reduced swells who wait on tables
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In August the family departed for the mountains, and the house
was left in charge of Jane and the cook, and right faithfully did
they fulfil the requirements of their stewardship.&nbsp; The
return in September found the house cleaned from top to
bottom.&nbsp; The hardwood floors and stairs shone as they had
rarely shone before, and as only an unlimited application of what
is vulgarly termed &ldquo;elbow-grease&rdquo; could make them
shine.&nbsp; The linen was immaculate.&nbsp; Ireland is not freer
from snakes than was the house of Perkins from cobwebs, and no
speck of dust except those on the travellers was visible.&nbsp;
It was evident that even in the absence of the family Jane was
true to her ideals, and the heart of Mrs. Perkins was glad.&nbsp;
Furthermore, Jane had acquired a full third set of teeth, which
seemed to take some of the lines from her face, and, as Perkins
observed, added materially to the general effect of the
surroundings, although they were distressingly new.&nbsp; But,
alas! they marked the beginning of the end.&nbsp; Jane ceased to
wait upon the table with that solemnity which is essential to the
manner of a &ldquo;treasure&rdquo;; she smiled occasionally, and
where hitherto she had treated the conversation at the table with
stolid indifference, a witticism would invariably now bring the
new teeth unto view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Thaddeus, &ldquo;our butleress has
evoluted backwards.&nbsp; She grins like an ordinary
waitress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too true.&nbsp; The possession of brilliantly white
teeth seemed to have brought with it a desire to show them, which
was destructive of that dignity with which Jane had previously
been hedged about, and substituted for it a less desirable
atmosphere of possible familiarity, which might grow upon very
slight provocation into intimacy, not to mention a nearer
approach to social equality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we can blame her exactly,&rdquo;
said Perkins, when discussing one or two of Jane&rsquo;s lapses
from her old-time standard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt
that if I&rsquo;d gone for years without teeth, I&rsquo;d become
a regular Cheshire cat, with a new, complete <i>&eacute;dition de
luxe</i> of celluloid molars.&nbsp; Still, I wish she&rsquo;d
paid more attention to the dinner and less to Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s
conversation last night.&nbsp; She stood a whole minute, with the
salad-bowl in her hand, waiting for him to reach the point of his
story about the plumber who put a gas-pipe through
Shakespeare&rsquo;s tenor in Westminster Abbey, and when he
finished, and she smiled, you&rsquo;d have thought a dozen
gravestones to the deceased&rsquo;s memory had been conjured up
before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small fault, Thaddeus,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Perkins, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll speak to her about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Perkins; &ldquo;let
it go; she means well, and when we got her we didn&rsquo;t
suspect she&rsquo;d turn out such a jewel.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
merely approaching her norm, that is all.&nbsp; We ought to be
thankful to have had such perfection for one year.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too bad it couldn&rsquo;t continue; but what
perfection does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing, therefore, was said, and Jane smiled on, yet waited
most acceptably and kept all things decently and in
order&mdash;for a little while.&nbsp; Along about Christmas-time
a further decadence and additional flaw in the jewel was
discovered, and it was Perkins himself who discovered it.&nbsp;
It happened one day while he was at work alone in the house, Mrs.
Perkins having gone out shopping.&nbsp; A friend from Boston
appeared&mdash;a friend interested in bric-&agrave;-brac and
china generally.&nbsp; Thaddeus, to whom a luncheon in solitary
grandeur was little short of abomination, invited his Boston
friend to stay and share pot-luck with him, knowing, hypocrite
that he was, that pot-luck did not mean pot-luck at all, but a
course luncheon which many men would have found all-sufficient at
dinner.&nbsp; The Boston friend accepted, and the luncheon was
served by Jane.&nbsp; In the course of the repast the visitor
observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good china you have, Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Thaddeus, &ldquo;pretty
good.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always had a <i>penchant</i> for
china.&nbsp; My mother-in-law thinks I&rsquo;m extravagant, and
sometimes I think she is right.&nbsp; You never saw my
Capodimonte coffees, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Bostonian, &ldquo;I never
did.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;d you get &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;London,&rdquo; replied Perkins, &ldquo;last time I was
over.&nbsp; You must see them, by all means.&nbsp; Ah, Jane, hand
Mr. Bunkerrill one of the Capodimonte coffees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wan o&rsquo; the what, sorr?&rdquo; asked the
treasure.</p>
<p>Thaddeus blushed.&nbsp; To have his jewel go back on him at
such a crisis was excessively annoying.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of those
gold after-dinner coffee-cups&mdash;one of the little ones, with
the flowery raised figures,&rdquo; he said, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;wan o&rsquo; thim with
somebody else&rsquo;s initial on the bottom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Thaddeus, fuming inwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a connoisseur, that woman,&rdquo; laughed the
visitor, as Jane went after the dinner-cup.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s observed the china mark.&nbsp; She
know&rsquo;s N doesn&rsquo;t stand for Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus laughed weakly.&nbsp; &ldquo;She probably thinks we
got them second-hand,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely you did,&rdquo; retorted the Bostonian, and
Jane returned with the desired cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;An admirable
specimen,&rdquo; continued the connoisseur; and them, turning the
cup bottom upwards in search of the mark, he disclosed to his own
and Thaddeus&rsquo;s astonished gaze no less an object than the
remains of a mashed green pea, a reminiscence of the last Perkins
dinner, and conclusive evidence that at times Jane was not as
careful in the washing of her china as she might have been.</p>
<p>It would be futile and useless for me to attempt to describe
the emotions of Thaddeus.&nbsp; I fancy a large enough number of
us having been through similar experiences to comprehend the
man&rsquo;s mortification and his inward wrath.&nbsp; It was too
great to find suitable expression at the moment.&nbsp; Nothing
short of the absolute destruction of the cup and the annihilation
of Jane could have adequately expressed Perkins&rsquo;s true
feelings.&nbsp; He was not by nature, however, a
scene-maker&mdash;it would have been better if he had
been&mdash;so he said nothing, abiding by his rule, which seemed
to be that the man of the house would do better to reprehend the
short-comings of a delinquent servant by blowing up his wife
rather than by going direct to the core of the trouble and
reading the maid a lecture.&nbsp; A great many men adopt this
same method.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; It is the easiest, though it is
possibly prompted by that cowardice which is latent with us
all.&nbsp; I never in my life have discharged more than one
servant, and I not only did not do it gracefully, but discharged
the wrong one; since which time I have left all that sort of work
to others more competent than I.&nbsp; Perkins&rsquo;s method was
precisely thus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to interfere,&rdquo; was his
invariable remark in cases of the kind under discussion; which
was unwise, for if he had even scolded a servant as he did his
wife for the servant&rsquo;s fault he might have secured better
service sooner or later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when Mrs. Perkins reached home that night she
was so very tired with her exertions in the shops that Thaddeus
hadn&rsquo;t the heart to tell her what had happened, and when
morning came the episode was forgotten.&nbsp; When it did recur
to his mind it so happened that Mrs. Perkins was out of
reach.&nbsp; The result was that a month had passed before Mrs.
Perkins cane into possession of the facts, and it was then, of
course, too late to mention it to Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have given her a good talking to at the
time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
awful!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what has got into Jane.&nbsp; My
best table-cloth has got a great hole in it, and she is very
careless with the silver.&nbsp; My fruit-knife last night was not
clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose <i>you</i> spoke to her about that?&rdquo;
said Perkins, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; I sent for another, and handed her the
dirty one,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Perkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess she
felt all that I could have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And time went on, and Jane continued to decay.&nbsp; She
pulled corks from olive-bottles with the carving-fork prongs and
bent them backwards.&nbsp; She developed a habit of going out and
leaving her work undone.&nbsp; The powdered sugar was allowed to
resolve itself into small, hard, pill-shaped lumps of various
sizes.&nbsp; Breakfast had a way of being served cold.&nbsp; The
coffee was at times merely tepid; in short, it seemed as if she
really ought to be discharged; but then there was invariably some
reason for postponing the fatal hour.&nbsp; Either her kindness
to the children or a week or two of the old-time efficiency, her
unyielding civility, her scrupulous honesty, her willing
acquiescence in any new duty imposed, an impression that she was
suffering, any one or all of these reasons kept her on in her
place until she became so much a fixture in the household, so
much one of the family, that the idea of getting rid of her
seemed beyond the possibility of realization.&nbsp; That the axe
should fall her employers knew well, and many a resolve was taken
that at the end of the season she should go, yet neither Mrs.
Perkins nor her husband liked to tell her so.&nbsp; Her good
points were still too potent, although none could deny that all
confidence in her efficiency was shattered past repair.&nbsp; The
situation finally reached a point where it inspired reflections
of a more or less humorous order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I think,&rdquo; said Thaddeus one
evening, after a particularly flagrant breach on Jane&rsquo;s
part, involving a streak of cranberry sauce across a
supposititiously clean plate: &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t discharge
her, Bess, and I won&rsquo;t; suppose we send for Mr. Burke, and
get him to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burke was the one reliable man in town.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t make much difference what the Perkinses wanted done,
they generally sent for Mr. Burke to do it, largely because when
he attempted a commission he saw it through.&nbsp; A carpenter
and builder by trade, he had for many years looked after the
repairs needful to the Perkins&rsquo; dwelling; he had come often
between Thaddeus and unskilled labor; he had made bookcases which
were dreams of convenience and sufficiently pleasing to the eye;
he had &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s garden; he had
supplied the family with a new gardener when the old one had
taken on habits of drink, which destroyed not only himself but
the cabbages; he had kept an eye on the plumbers; he had put up,
taken down, and repaired awnings&mdash;in short, as Perkins said,
he was a &ldquo;Universal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, when a delicate
piece of bric-&agrave;-brac had been broken and the china-mender
asserted that it could not be mended, Perkins had said,
&ldquo;See if Burke can&rsquo;t fix it,&rdquo; and Burke had
fixed it; and as final tribute to this wonder, Perkins had said,
in suffering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m afraid I have appendicitis.&nbsp;
Send for Mr. Burke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burke!&rdquo; echoed his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Burke,&rdquo; moaned the sufferer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If my vermiform appendix is to be removed, I&rsquo;d
rather have Mr. Burke do it with a chisel and saw than any
surgeon I know; and I won&rsquo;t take ether either, because it
is such a satisfaction to see him work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, when this happy pair of house-holders had reached what
might be described as the grand climateric of their patience, and
it was finally decided that Jane&rsquo;s usefulness was a thing
of the past, and utterly beyond redemption, Thaddeus naturally
suggested turning to his faithful friend, Mr. Burke, to rid them
of their woes, and, indeed, but for Jane&rsquo;s own
intervention, I fear that course would have proved the sole
alternative to her becoming an irremovable fixture in the
household.&nbsp; But it was Jane herself who solved the
problem.</p>
<p>It was two days after the cranberry episode that the solution
came, and it was in this wise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye send for me?&rdquo; Jane asked, suddenly
materializing in Mrs. Perkins&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jane, I haven&rsquo;t; why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl began to shed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;you&rsquo;d ought to have,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I know well enough that I ain&rsquo;t
satisfactory to you,&rdquo; she returned, her voice quivering,
&ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t be, and I know you want me to
go&mdash;and I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve come to give you
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Perkins looked at Jane with sorrow on her
countenance, for she had acquired an affection for her which the
maid&rsquo;s delinquencies had not been able to efface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you try and do better?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
with the system&mdash;never.&nbsp; Mr. Perkins is too easy, and
you do be so soft-hearted it don&rsquo;t keep a girl up to her
work.&nbsp; When I first come here, ma&rsquo;am, not
knowin&rsquo; ye well, I was afraid to be anything but what was
right, but the way you took accidents, and a bit of a
shortcomin&rsquo; once in a while, sort of took away my fear, and
I&rsquo;ve been goin&rsquo; down hill ever since.&nbsp;
Servant-girls is only human, Mrs. Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkins looked at Jane inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needs to be kept up to our work just as much as
anybody else, and when a lady like yourself is too easy, it gets
a girl into bad habits, and occasionally it does us good if the
gentleman of the house will swear at us, Mrs. Perkins, and sort
of scare us, so it does.&nbsp; It was that that was the making of
me.&nbsp; The last place I was in, ma&rsquo;am, I was so afraid
of both the missus and the gentleman that I didn&rsquo;t dare to
be careless; and I didn&rsquo;t dare be careless with you until I
found you all the time a-smilin&rsquo;, whatever went wrong, and
Mr. Perkins never sayin&rsquo; a word, whether the dishes come to
the table clean or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins, somewhat carried
away by this course of reasoning, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t been
what we hoped&mdash;there is no denying that; but knowing that
you were disappointing us, why couldn&rsquo;t you have made a
special effort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Perkins,&rdquo; sobbed the poor woman,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all
disappointin&rsquo; to them we loves, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s them
we fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why aren&rsquo;t you afraid of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane laughed through her tears.&nbsp; The idea was
preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of you and Mr. Perkins?&nbsp; Ah!&rdquo; she
said, sadly, &ldquo;if I only could be&mdash;but I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why, Mrs. Perkins, if Mr. Perkins should come
in here now and swear at me the way Mr. Barley did when I worked
there, I&rsquo;d know he was only puttin&rsquo; it on, and that
inside he&rsquo;d be laughin&rsquo; at me.&nbsp; No, ma&rsquo;am,
it&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; I feel that I must go, or I&rsquo;ll be
forever ruined.&nbsp; It was the cranberry showed me; a girl had
ought to be discharged for that.&nbsp; Dirty dinner plates
isn&rsquo;t excusable, and yet neither of you said a word, and
next week it&rsquo;ll be the same way&mdash;so I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo;.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t send me off, so I&rsquo;ve got
to do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Perkins; &ldquo;if
that is the way you feel about it we&rsquo;ll have to part, I
suppose.&nbsp; I am sorry, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence was not finished, for Jane rushed weeping from
the room, and within a few days, her place having been filled,
the house knew her no more, except as an occasional visitor,
ostensibly to see the children.&nbsp; Later she got a place to
her satisfaction, and one night the Perkins were invited to dine
with Jane&rsquo;s new employers.&nbsp; They went and found their
old-time &ldquo;butler&rdquo; at the very zenith of her
powers.&nbsp; She served the dinner as she had never served one
in her palmiest days in the Perkins&rsquo;s dining-room; and when
all was over, and when Mrs. Perkins went up-stairs to don her
wrap to return home, she found Jane above waiting to help
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you so happy, Jane,&rdquo; she said,
as the girl held her cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m not very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be, here.&nbsp; Your work to-night was
perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;it had to be,
for&rdquo;&mdash;here her voice fell to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t dare let it be different, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Mrs.
Harkins is a regular divvle, and the ould gentleman&mdash;well,
ma&rsquo;am, he do swear finer &rsquo;n any gentleman I ever
met.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just the place for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jane sighed as her old mistress left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she great, Bess?&rdquo; said Thaddeus, on
the way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was, indeed,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Perkins, with a
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity I&rsquo;m not a
divvle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thaddeus laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;or that I never learned to swear like a gentleman,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

description: They were very young, and possibly too amiable. Thaddeus was but twenty-four
  and Bessie twenty-two when they twain, made one, walked down the middle aisle of
  St. Peter's together. Everybody remarked how amiable she looked even then; not that
  a bride on her way out of church should look unamiable, of course, but we all know
  how brides do look, as a rule, on such occasions - looks difficult of analysis,
  but strangely suggestive of determined timidity, if there can be such a quality
  expressed in the human face. It is the natural expression of one who knows that
  she has taken the most.
